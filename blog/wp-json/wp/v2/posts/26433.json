If you\u2019re not a developer, or don\u2019t have any coding knowledge, then using a static CMS can be very difficult and frustrating. With WordPress, the only thing you need to do is install the content management system onto your website. Once that&#8217;s done, you&#8217;re ready to start adding posts or pages as required.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Static Content Management Systems (CMS) are a popular choice for small businesses because they&#8217;re easy to use and manage. However, there are many disadvantages of using a static CMS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One disadvantage of using a static CMS is that it can be challenging to update and maintain. For instance, if your website needs to be updated with new features or content, you will need to update the entire CMS codebase. This can be time-consuming and challenging, specifically if you don&#8217;t have any development experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another disadvantage of using a static CMS is that it can be difficult to find the right template for your website. This is because most static <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/ecommerce-cms\/top-cms-platform-for-website-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CMS platforms<\/a> rely on pre-made templates that may not be suited for your specific business or website. You&#8217;ll likely need to customise these templates to fit your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, static CMS platforms can be slow and inefficient when it comes to handling large volumes of traffic. They rely on pre-built templates and internal algorithms that can take longer than traditional web hosting solutions to load.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Embrace WordPress Excellence<\/div>\n    <p>Unleash your website's potential with WordPress - anytime, anywhere!<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\">\n    <a href=\" https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;amp;utm_medium=SK_26433_a24&amp;amp;utm_campaign=webblogcontact\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Contact Us<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Current_Market_For_WordPress_Websites\"><\/span><strong>The Current Market For WordPress Websites<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many freelance developers and agency owners have been turning to open-source software to avoid potential pitfalls.

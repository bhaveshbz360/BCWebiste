You can install it using the NuGet package manager.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The AutoMapper library is a convention-based object-to-object mapping library. It can automatically map the properties of one object to another, making it easy to convert data between different formats.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In general, AutoMapper offers mapping from an input object type to an output object type, although custom conventions can be developed by deriving from existing conventions and overriding convention behavior.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The Auto in AutoMapper refers to how mapping information is read from\u00a0.NET attributes. A convention for defining these attributes allows for strongly typed mapping configuration with minimal boilerplate code.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The Mapper part of AutoMapper refers to the automatic generation of C# POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) classes that serve as mapping factories for your objects and their properties when you use attributes for defining mappings.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_SaasKit\"><\/span>2.

It provides features such as multi-tenancy, subscription management, billing, and more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">SaasKit is a set of NuGet packages that help reduce boilerplate code and simplify common tasks when building a Software as a Service application. It includes many services like Google Analytics, Twilio, Disqus, SendGrid, MailChimp, and others. Using this library is super easy!<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Just install them from NuGet or the package manager console and start using them! The library also integrates with other libraries, so there\u2019s minimal setup to get started.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Moreover, it\u2019s very powerful, stable, and works well in both multi-tenant and single-tenant cases. You can choose whether to host your own instance or use SaasKit Cloud Services ( SaaS ).<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_Polly\"><\/span>3.

Polly is fully integrated with an application\u2019s event system, but it is also usable independently, as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This makes it possible for specific events or series of events to be translated into different failure types in code blocks. It offers several built-in implementations such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback, which can be configured according to the environment and business needs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">More than 200 libraries are already using Polly in their production apps, such as Google AdWords, AirBnB, etc. The best thing about Polly is that it supports NLog along with System. Diagnostics for logging exceptions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Moreover, it also offers remote configuration through Azure Application Insights so that it can be updated dynamically. If there is any change in policy, then changes could directly be pushed without writing any code changes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Developers could get started right away by including just two files into their project \u2013the NuGet package and adding some attributes. Its performance doesn\u2019t depend on batching, so if there is one exception during the retry process, then everything else would continue to execute successfully before calling the OnRetry method.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_MailKit_NET_Library\"><\/span>4. MailKit\u00a0.NET Library<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">MailKit provides a simple and powerful email sending API. The library is 100% managed C# code and allows developers to take advantage of SMTP connections, custom envelope data, attachments, TLS\/SSL communication, and more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Everything can be accomplished through MailKit\u2019s object-oriented interface in just a few lines of code. For example, below is a quick snippet that sends an email with MailKit. The whole process takes less than 15 seconds. No configuration is required.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The current version supports\u00a0.NET 4.5, Windows Phone 8.1, and Windows Store applications using XAML and Window 8 Metro (Windows Runtime) applications written using C# or Visual Basic\u00a0.NET language.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Moreover, MailKit also includes a MIME and message parser for parsing messages from different sources such as webmail services or third-party APIs. This library does not have any 3rd party dependencies.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Dapper\"><\/span>5.

It\u2019s a simple, lightweight library that makes working with databases incredibly easy\u200a\u2014\u200aa perfect way to work with your existing relational database from\u00a0.NET.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It exposes a simple interface over data that removes virtually all of the boilerplate code that would otherwise be required when writing SQL statements by hand or using other ORM systems. After you have something in memory that represents your data, getting it into another format takes only a single line of code.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In most cases, it\u2019s possible to do it without ever having to leave a memory! Its power comes from its simplicity: there are no events or rules attached to queries in order to produce clean, readable code.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You don\u2019t even need any knowledge of TSQL (or LINQ). Simply create your command, add parameters as needed and call execute(). With dapper, dealing with databases in C# has become fun again.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Sometimes it might be difficult for normal people to make use of the Polly features and functionalities; in that case, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/hire-developers?utm_source=Hire_Comp&amp;utm_medium=+Net+Core+Libraries&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_24157\">hire developers<\/a>.

It is especially useful for debugging purposes, allowing developers to easily track down bugs and errors in their programs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The logging information can be used with a number of different output methods, and it supports remote debugging. This makes it an extremely versatile tool that every developer will find useful at some point or another.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">An exceptional logging system like NLog could make all the difference when it comes to debugging your applications. Fortunately, there are now many excellent logging libraries available for\u00a0.NET.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One such solution is NLog. So if you\u2019re still using legacy tools such as Log4Net or Enterprise Library, then switching to something more advanced would certainly be worth considering.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Also Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/app-development\/node-js-vs-net-vs-php-choosing-the-right-stack-for-software-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Node.js vs .NET vs. PHP: Choosing the Right Stack for Software Development<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"9_DiagnosticsHealthChecks\"><\/span>9.

This library would be particularly useful in continuous integration scenarios where it is necessary to send out an alert when something is about to break but does not yet have any known way of breaking.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">With HealthChecks, you can let monitoring systems know about upcoming problems so that issues can be resolved before they affect end users. In addition to several\u00a0.NET CLR-based health monitors, HealthChecks also supports writing health monitors in Windows PowerShell.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A Windows PowerShell script is run every time one of its conditions changes state; there\u2019s no need to recompile your project or restart your application (if one exists).<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"10_LiteDB\"><\/span>10.

If you are using\u00a0.NET on any platform other than Windows or do not have Java installed, LiteDB is another alternative for your project.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Not only can LiteDB connect to SQL, but it also comes with a high-performance client library named LightSpeed, which can be used as an alternative to Entity Framework Core as well as NancyFx.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you need flexible data storage options, then open-source programming can improve your programs without incurring extra costs.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"11_Bcryptnet\"><\/span>11.

NET\u2019s System.Security.Cryptography namespace or via Microsoft\u2019s extension method as defined in Microsoft\u2019s MSDN documentation for BCrypt.HashData.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In addition, if one wishes access just to the string representation of their hash, then they may do so via GetHashString() without having to actually generate it first.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"12_FastReport\"><\/span>12.

FastReport provides object-oriented programming and works well with different databases. It is lightweight and easy to use.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">FastReport helps developers in developing applications that require reporting capability. You can generate reports by calling their methods or properties; no need for any coding while generating reports.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, creating a pie chart from database table data is possible without writing a single line of code. Its charts are very customizable; as an example, you can change the report background color and paper margin from code without modifying your application UI form.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The fast report generates data quickly due to its low memory footprint, so it does not affect system performance when running on production servers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Another advantage of using a fast report is caching feature, which automatically caches previously available reports if they have not been modified, thus saving time in re-generating them again.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Also Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/outsourcing-and-off-shoring\/php-vs-mean-stack-vs-net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MEAN Stack vs. PHP vs .Net: What\u2019s the Best Choice for You?<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">.NET Core libraries are a great way to improve your application without sacrificing performance. Each of these libraries can help you in different ways, so it is important to choose the one that best suits your needs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Additionally, to make your project easier, some of these libraries have Nuget packages, which you can install with a few simple commands. If I talk about the top three\u00a0.NET Core libraries, then I will suggest you go with AutoMapper, Polly, or Dapper. As per the research, I found these three are the libraries that are widely used by the developers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So go ahead and try out one or more of these libraries in your next project. If you have any sort of difficulty in using the dotNET core libraries, then get connected with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techieapps.com\/top-10-asp-net-development-companies-globally\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">best ASP NET development company in India<\/a> (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ValueCoders<\/a>).

To get better, the algorithm changes how the nodes are connected to make fewer mistakes, using a method called backpropagation.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Benefits_of_DL\"><\/span><b>Benefits of DL<\/b><b><\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">Deep learning offers several key advantages:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 500;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Improved Results:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\"> Deep learning algorithms can reach extremely high levels of accuracy and effectiveness in jobs like recognizing images, understanding language, and creating speech.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 500;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Self-Learning:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\"> Deep learning systems can learn and change by themselves when they get new data, cutting down on the need for people to step in and program them every time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 500;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Flexibility:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\"> Deep learning models can be used in many different areas and industries, like healthcare, finance, self-driving cars, and robots.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Types_of_DL\"><\/span><b>Types of DL<\/b><b><\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 500;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\"> CNNs are really good at jobs like recognizing images, finding objects, and understanding what&#8217;s in pictures.

But it means so much more than that on an app like Tinder.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While enterprise apps don\u2019t need such levels of form-over-function approach as in the case of consumer-oriented apps, there is a growing demand for features that make the task of using such apps engaging.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigating through an off-the-shelf <a href=\"https:\/\/www.selectsoftwarereviews.com\/buyer-guide\/applicant-tracking-systems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ATS (Applicant Tracking Software) software<\/a> that gives you bland notifications on suitable job candidates can get boring after a time. But adding a human element to it, say with a hyperactive AI bot that provides such information in a conversational way changes the entire experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But can immersive experiences with enterprise software justify the costs potentially incurred to add such features?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not in the short term, but definitely in the longer run. A one-time focus on creating a seamlessly integrated design of the entire systems ecosystem adds to the enterprise value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If an employee is used to operating one enterprise system software (which has an immersive, engaging UX) for their job-related purposes, they&#8217;ll find it much easier to adapt to other enterprise software that&#8217;s part of the organization ecosystem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This fact is already proven in the realm of consumer software and apps. <\/span><b>If you use an Apple iPhone, you&#8217;ll likely find it easier to navigate through other Apple devices such as an iPad or a MacBook.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you use an office application suite such as the Google G Suite or Microsoft Office 365, then you&#8217;d know how easy it is to recognize, understand and navigate through their individual apps owing to the familiarity in them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This practice of making users addicted to an ecosystem works so well that a Forrester report estimated revenue generation of\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$100 for every $1 spent on UX<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in consumer-focused apps!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But enterprise software is an entirely different ball game where each feature, each addition is meant to enhance productivity and increase efficiency rather than entice its users, i.e., those working for the enterprise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is why things are a bit rough if you consider increasing costs to build immersive experiences in enterprise software. <\/span><b>Increasing costs is only justified if a new design approach helps in achieving certain objectives.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some great examples of enterprises that have managed to do this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take for instance, how Boeing achieved a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40 percent increase in productivity<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by using AR for providing electrical installation training to employees.

However, they come with their own share of drawbacks too.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, off-the-shelf software may come with a lot of redundant features that may never be used by an organization.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, a business using off-the-shelf enterprise software has to formulate its functions centered around the software instead of the other way around.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have seen some enterprises fall victim to the second drawback I just mentioned. One firm I worked with had to <\/span><b>design their entire employee attendance policies around an off-the-shelf attendance tracking software! <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That happened only because they weren&#8217;t able to customize the software configuration as per their policies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, some off-the-shelf enterprise software comes with heavy customization capabilities, but those only add up to the size they take and consequently require more hardware resources to perform at the optimum level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, there are certain advantages when using custom enterprise software:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With custom enterprise software, an organization can add and deploy only the required features and build the enterprise system centered around the internal business environment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A custom enterprise software\u2019s biggest advantage I feel is in terms of security. <\/span><b>Every popular off-the-shelf enterprise software is used by hundreds of companies.

The other major challenges faced by enterprises were related to the lack of skilled IT Resources and project budget constraints.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One point I have stressed upon from the start of this article is the need for enterprise software to be integrated across all functions of the business. Well, that starts with the task of maintaining harmony among the IT and operational units.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful enterprise software is one that seamlessly integrates all functions of an enterprise into a single medium of access. <\/span><b>No business would prefer working with multiple software each for covering different functions such as Recruitment, Accounting, Payroll, among others<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is another case where a CIO faces a challenge between choosing an off-the-shelf or custom enterprise software. <\/span><b>An off-the-shelf application can never have the potential of completely seamless integration as is possible through a custom one.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take an example here. Say, an ATS application used by an enterprise tracks recruitment data perfectly. It provides information about potential job candidates, helps in screening resumes, and lets an HR in om important information about future employees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if this ATS isn\u2019t integrated with the main <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/case-studies\/hr-management-portal\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=hrm_13256&amp;utm_campaign=sme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HRM software<\/a>, then all data about the prospective job candidates would have to be re-written into another software! A seamlessly integrated custom enterprise software saves an HR executive from this hassle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a similar pattern, enterprise systems can bring a whole new level of efficiency and productivity when perfectly integrated with both IT and non-IT functions of an organization.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Setting_the_right_Priorities\"><\/span><strong>5. Setting the right Priorities<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the greatest challenges in enterprise software development comes well before the start of a project. Setting the right priorities for enterprise software goes a long way in determining the potential of the end product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where the role of a CIO and other IT leaders becomes so crucial. Technically, it is the CIO\u2019s role to manage the whole cycle of enterprise software development. However, <\/span><b>who he\/she reports to can have a huge role to play in how the project takes shape.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the IT leader or the CIO reports to the CFO, the priorities might lie in reducing costs, enhancing the financial output or ROI out of the project, etc. <\/span><b>If the CIO reports directly to the CEO, the priorities might be of a much broader scope, which is necessary considering how an enterprise software affects an organization\u2019s functioning.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider this analogy: the Enterprise software is a movie. The CIO is the producer of this movie, and the one whom he reports to is the director and holds the responsibility to direct this project towards an objective.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The higher the position of the reporting manager of the CIO, the greater the chances are of it being wider in terms of scope and implementation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Should I outsource Enterprise Software Development to another firm, or should I get it done in-house?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TL;DR: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=home_13256&amp;utm_campaign=sme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Outsourcing software development<\/a> is the best option if your core business isn\u2019t associated with the technology sector. Developing software in-house is best if you already have a skilled workforce or human capital capable of handling such a project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if you\u2019re in for a verbose answer, here goes:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 11 years of my career as a Technology expert and Consultant, I have worked on both in-house and outsourcing software development projects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From that experience, I can tell you what you\u2019re getting into in both these cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Should you opt to start with an in-house enterprise software development project, there would be a huge load of things to look over as an IT leader.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will need to hire skilled developers and Project managers to work through the entire project.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An investment in hardware resources to develop the software will be necessary. These won\u2019t be huge problems if your enterprise is already into the High Tech industry but would be incredibly worrisome for a company not associated with the IT industry in any way.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you\u2019re creating an entirely new in-house team for the project, there will be no clear way to define or analyze the cumulative experience of your team in handling the problems at hand.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the positive side, you will have more control over an in-house team and can regulate the pace of the project as necessary.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication with teams will be effortless with an in-house development team.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, outsourcing your project too comes with its own share of pros and cons:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best thing about outsourcing software development is that your project will be at the hands of people who know their job well. A software development firm\u2019s experience plays a huge role in maintaining a smooth project workflow.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An enterprise wouldn\u2019t have to waste its time hiring new people and investing in hardware resources.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, communication with the remote development teams will be a tough affair.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When outsourcing software development, you get to choose the type of developers you want for your team.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all business leaders are supposed to be fully aware of the details about new, existing and emerging technologies. Outsourcing a software project lets you coordinate with experienced project managers who can fill any knowledge gaps, thereby saving your project from potential roadblocks.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re budget conscious, then an in-house project could perhaps save some of your expenses in software development at the cost of taking away the business\u2019 focus from its core expertise. Outsourcing, while being costlier also lets your enterprise focus on its core expertise while letting a software development firm take the workload of the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_How_do_you_think_Enterprise_Software_will_evolve\"><\/span><strong>3. How do you think Enterprise Software will evolve?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, data and emerging technologies such as AI and IoT are taking center stage as the drivers of innovation. Businesses and governments are now understanding the need to collect data, analyze and leverage it for meaningful purposes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it is already highlighted in the Forrester Global tech purchases report of years 2016-2021 that I shared above, enterprises are investing huge amounts of monetary resources to understand the modern technologies. They\u2019re trying to find use cases that create change and bring efficiency in tasks where we never thought of an alternative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe the evolution of enterprise software will be led by data and the pursuit of getting the data right. Data is the crucial component to some of the most important technologies we\u2019re surrounded by today. It is the fuel that drives the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you ask me for the ideal path where you would want to take your enterprise software- my advice would be to make it as data-oriented as possible. As far as finding opportunities for business or profitability is concerned, my bet would always be on data-oriented approaches to find the right solutions 99 times out of 100!<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Optimize Your Software Development Strategies<\/div>\n    <p>Learn how to navigate challenges and optimize your development process.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\">\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/contact?utm_source=Web_blog_13256&amp;utm_medium=SK&amp;utm_id=Contactus\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Connect today!<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Over_To_You\"><\/span><strong>Over To You<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>The total <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/203428\/total-enterprise-software-revenue-forecast\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>IT spending on enterprise software<\/b><\/a><b> will reach $503 US Dollars by the end of this year.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Considering that it&#8217;s the fastest-growing segment in the IT industry, enterprises need to gear up and see how they can leverage enterprise software by addressing challenges such as those I just mentioned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the enterprise clients I have worked with throughout my career have faced these challenges. I\u2019ll honestly tell you, some of these, even select <\/span><b>Fortune 1000 firms were on a completely wrong track with their goals for enterprise software development!\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why while handling my duties at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ValueCoders<\/a>, I work with due consideration to ensure none of the enterprise leaders we deal with run-up into any of these challenges. In fact, giving a clear view of potential roadblocks in the development cycle is a crucial part of the project onboarding process for our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=blog_al&amp;utm_medium=custom_13256&amp;utm_campaign=sme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">custom software development services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s summarize this post. We understood how immersive enterprise software can actually justify higher development costs (when using select technologies that make something easier). I explained how investment in enterprise applications can only deliver significant ROI in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, we saw why the lack of integration between IT and non-IT functions in enterprise software development is such a challenge. Finally, the last challenge points to the fact that the direction of an enterprise software project depends on the one overseeing the CIO, the greater their position and guidance, the higher the scope for the final product.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The ever-changing dynamics of the economy and technology make it hard for a CIO to meet existing enterprise demands while&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":13257,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[465],"tags":[4412,4367,2499],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Navigating Challenges in Enterprise Software: A Guide for CIOs<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Explore the top 5 challenges faced by CIOs in enterprise software development.

Also, the market size of IT outsourcing is expected to reach <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">$938 billion by 2027<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"graf-image aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/0*xeHEE4q-6iyEHEA1\" data-image-id=\"0*xeHEE4q-6iyEHEA1\" data-width=\"600\" data-height=\"300\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The fundamental reasons for this are lower costs and access to a larger, more talented labor pool. You can also improve collaboration and optimize the management of your software development projects by setting up an ODC.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">However, setting up and managing an offshore development center (ODC) can be daunting. When setting up an offshore development center, you must stick to some basic principles.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In this blog, we will explain some essential elements of setting up an offshore development center.

This way they can get more information and make their decision easier.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Unfortunately, this \u201cexcellent\u201d plan seldom works and causes problems. A candidate can get interview calls from all recruitment agencies and be perplexed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So, one ultimate solution is to keep it local by dealing directly with one recruitment agency who knows your company and the candidates inside out.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Don\u2019t Ignore employer branding<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Employer branding can be a powerful tool in the recruitment process.

This is because employees in offshore development centers are often more experienced, which means that they don\u2019t require as much supervision.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Additionally, having a long-term relationship with their offshore development center allows companies to build trust and ensure that everything will go smoothly.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Better Focus on Vision and Strategy<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">An offshore development center can be an excellent way for companies to focus on their vision and strategy. By outsourcing work to an offshore development center, companies can free up their employees to work on more crucial tasks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This can ensure that employees are constantly working on high-priority tasks and don\u2019t waste their time doing low-priority, lesser important work.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Increased Control<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">An offshore development center allows companies to have increased control over the work.

Moreover, outsourcing services give up control to a third party.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">With an ODC, you are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure. With outsourcing, the third party will design, build, and maintain the infrastructure for you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Also, you are responsible for managing and securing your data with an ODC. With outsourcing, the third party controls and secures your data on your behalf.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">An ODC provides more autonomy and flexibility than outsourcing. An ODC can be tailored to meet your specific needs, whereas an outsourced system is likely to be one-size-fit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For over two decades, offshore software development has been a mainstay of the global software development industry.

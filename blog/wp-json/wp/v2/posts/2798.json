For example: offering an online quiz on your site so users can determine which offer is best for them, and their needs could be easily created by one knowledgeable in this field.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If there isn\u2019t already someone who knows how to do it when we find ourselves without developers at our disposal (imagine if they became unavailable), then all those plugins sitting idly just waiting until needed might as well stay where they\u2019re put because once again-their performance impacts SERP rankings negatively anyway.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">WordPress is the ultimate tool for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/top-wordpress-development-services-company-india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>WordPress web development<\/strong><\/a>,\u00a0any business looking to quickly and easily create their own website.

The design may also be commonly found on other sites as these themes are picked up by many other companies.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Building your own theme<\/strong> on the other hand has many advantages. It can be customized to specific business requirements and niches. This may cost more but offers options to develop a website with lighter code and one that\u2019s more according to business requirements.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Customizing an existing theme<\/strong> is also an option but has challenges with respect to incorporating updates in the theme.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Try to decipher, whether the developer has clarity with respect to the above options and why would he suggest a particular option for your project.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Q_2_How_would_you_Simplify_content_management_on_my_website\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Q. 2<\/strong> <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">How would you Simplify content management on my website?<\/strong><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Ans.<\/strong> Managing the content on a WordPress site is usually simple.

Use Widgets to add content on the home page.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">2. The Menus feature in WordPress for adding menus on the site.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">3.

It takes a lot to keep people interested these days. Even if you make your website as easy and intuitive as possible, they\u2019ll still leave after 3 seconds of loading time- which is why it\u2019s so important for developers or companies not only to understand how crucial fast page loads actually can be but also do everything in their power (especially on mobile) towards achieving them!<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Q_9_How_would_you_ensure_the_security_of_my_WordPress_site\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Q. 9 How would you ensure the security of my WordPress site?<\/strong><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Ans.

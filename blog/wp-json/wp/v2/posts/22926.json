For example, both platforms offer support for multi signatures and smart contracts while also being able to handle over 1000 transactions per second.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, they each utilize their own consensus algorithm, which means businesses won&#8217;t have to switch from one technology to another if they want different processing speeds.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Stellar_Vs_Hyperledger_Fabric_Which_Blockchain_Platform_Is_The_Best\"><\/span><strong>Stellar Vs Hyperledger Fabric: Which Blockchain Platform Is The Best?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here I have compared the few parameters which will help you analyze which one is best among Hyperledger Fabric vs Stellar.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Performance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comparing Stellar and Hyperledger Fabric on paper, it is clear that the latter has an advantage. The biggest thing working in Hyperledger&#8217;s favor is its transaction confirmation time which only takes a mere three to five seconds to process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes it easy for businesses of all sizes to integrate into their workflows without slowing down productivity or causing frustration among employees. Stellar, on the other hand, is a bit slower and not as well suited for companies that need to do processing at scale.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Security<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to security, there are various factors you want your Blockchain platform to have before making an investment in its technology. First of all, you should look for solutions that use Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) because that provides the highest level of security to date.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hyperledger Fabric was one of the first Blockchain platforms to be developed, so it definitely has an advantage in this department over Stellar, which is much newer and therefore lacking some advanced security features.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Customer Support &amp; Community<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One area where Stellar really shines is in customer support and community. The team behind the Stellar Blockchain platform is extremely active, which means that they are always working to improve their product by incorporating feedback from users around the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This provides a much greater level of transparency than Hyperledger Fabric can offer because there isn&#8217;t as strong of an open-source codebase available for it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Scalability\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest problems <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/hire-developers\/hire-blockchain-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blockchain developers<\/a> are trying to solve is how to make their platforms scalable. Scalability can be measured by transaction speed, and it&#8217;s an area where Hyperledger Fabric excels over Stellar. Additionally, Stellar is capable of processing 1000 transactions per second, while Hyperledger Fabric process 3500 transactions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Popularity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last thing you want to consider when looking for a Blockchain solution is its popularity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Stellar has only been around since 2014, it&#8217;s quickly becoming one of the most popular Blockchains thanks to its ability to connect people across borders and offer them faster transactions than they can get with traditional methods like wire transfers or ACH payments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It currently sits at the number seven spot on CoinMarketCap&#8217;s list of most valuable cryptocurrencies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hyperledger Fabric, however, is much more popular than Stellar and has been around since 2015; it sits at the number eleven spot on CoinMarketCap. This advantage in popularity can be attributed to Hyperledger having access to incredible resources like IBM who are able to help it gain significant ground in the Blockchain space.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, if you are focusing on Smart Contract Development, <\/span><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/hire-developers\/hire-smartcontract-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hire Smart Contract developers<\/a>. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By doing so, you will be able to work on the Smart Contract project efficiently.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Choose Your Blockchain Path Today!<\/div>\n    <p>Discover the Ideal Platform: Stellar or Hyperledger Fabric?<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\">\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/contact?utm_source=Web_blog_22926&amp;utm_medium=SK&amp;utm_id=Contactus\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Contact us!<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Pros_and_Cons_of_Stellar_and_Hyperledger_Fabric\"><\/span><strong>Pros and Cons of Stellar and Hyperledger Fabric<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here I have mentioned the pros and cons of using Stellar and Hyperledger Fabric; knowing the same, you can examine which one is best.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Pros_of_using_Stellar\"><\/span><strong>Pros of using Stellar<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-&gt; Transaction confirmation time is very fast: Stellar can process transactions in three to five seconds.

This is important to note because many companies choose Stellar based on its reputation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But they have no ability to use it due to their location or other factors that would prevent them from putting up a valid account for this Blockchain solution.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-&gt; There are some concerns about the platform&#8217;s security features being weak compared to other Blockchain networks that are currently available.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Pros_of_Hyperledger_Fabric\"><\/span><strong>Pros of Hyperledger Fabric<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>-&gt; Hyperledger has a much faster transaction verification time than Stellar. It can also handle more daily transactions as well. Hence, it is a great option for businesses that need their platform to be able to work with high volumes of orders or data on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>-&gt; Hyperledger Fabric is a flexible platform. It can be used for both smart contracts and asset trading. Thus, it makes an excellent choice if your company needs to work with a variety of different types of data.<\/p>\n<p>-&gt; There are no transaction fees associated with Hyperledger Fabric.

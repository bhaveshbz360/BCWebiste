IoT-enabled mobile devices capture data in real-time, but most of them lack adherence to data protocols and standards.<\/div>\n<div data-key=\"96\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\" data-key=\"98\">There is significant ambiguity regarding data ownership and regulation. Hence, the data stored within IoT-enabled devices are prone to data thefts and it makes the data more susceptible to cybercriminals that can hack into the system to compromise personal health information.<\/div>\n<div data-key=\"98\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\" data-key=\"98\">Some examples of misuse of IoT device data are fraudulent health claims and the creation of fake IDs for buying and selling drugs.<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 class=\"paragraph\" data-key=\"100\"><strong>2) Integration: Multiple Devices &amp; Protocols:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\" data-key=\"104\">The integration of multiple types of devices causes hindrance in the implementation of IoT in the healthcare sector. The reason behind this hindrance is that device manufacturers haven\u2019t reached a consensus regarding communication protocol and standards.<\/div>\n<div data-key=\"104\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\" data-key=\"104\">This results in a scenario where every manufacturer creates its own separate ecosystem of IoT devices that do not work with the devices and applications of competing manufacturers. In such a situation, there is no synchronous protocol that could be followed for data aggregation. This non-uniformity slows down the process and reduces the scope of scalability of IoT in healthcare.<\/div>\n<h3 class=\"paragraph\" data-key=\"108\"><strong data-slate-mark=\"true\">3) Data Overload and Accuracy:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\" data-key=\"110\">Due to the non-uniformity of data and communication protocols, it is difficult to aggregate data for vital insights and analysis. IoT collects data in bulk and for proper data analysis, the data need to be segregated in chunks without overloading with precise accuracy for better results. Moreover, the overloading of data might affect the decision-making process in the hospitality sector in the longer run.<\/div>\n<h3 class=\"paragraph\" data-key=\"112\"><strong>4) Cost:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\" data-key=\"116\">\n<p>You might not be surprised to see this point here.\u00a0 Costs are one of the greater challenges when planning to consider IoT app development for healthcare mobility solutions. However, the costs are completely worth it if the IoT implementation is one that solves a genuine problem.<\/p>\n<p>While you will spend a significant amount of money and resources in developing an IoT application, the returns will be equally huge when your business saves time and manpower, all while improving the business processes, generating more revenue streams, and creating more business opportunities through IoT.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Don't Let Challenges Hinder Your IoT Healthcare Vision<\/div>\n    <p>Get tailored solutions for your unique requirements with our IoT developers expertise.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\">\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/contact\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Connect Today!<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 data-key=\"122\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_the_applications_of_IoT_in_Healthcare\"><\/span>What are the applications of IoT in Healthcare?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<div class=\"paragraph\" data-key=\"126\">IoT applications in healthcare are meant not just for the healthcare institutions, but for the patients too!

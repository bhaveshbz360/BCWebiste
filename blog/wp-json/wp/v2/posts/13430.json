The outbreak that started from Wuhan, China in December 2019, has created havoc at a global level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From 1 person in Wuhan to over 4,00,000 cases all across the world, this all has just happened in 3 months!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After creating footprints in countries like China, Italy, Iran and the United States of America, it has reached down to India, a country of 1.3 Billion population, who are now facing disastrous consequences with over <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/emergencies\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019\/situation-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b><i>500+ confirmed cases till date as per the recent reports by WHO.\u00a0<\/i><\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever imagined the toll it has taken on the health infrastructure and para-medical facilities? Not only our healthcare industry, but this pandemic situation has also created rough times for major businesses in the picture. Our global economy is on a low down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a look at how it will impact businesses in the coming days.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_would_be_the_Impact_of_COVID-19_on_Businesses\"><\/span><strong>What would be the Impact of COVID-19 on Businesses?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COVID-19 has almost disrupted industries from tourism, hardware manufacturing, automobile, among other industrial sectors. OECD reports that the global economy will face <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oecd.org\/economic-outlook\/june-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b><i>the slowest growth<\/i><\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since 2009 due to the impacts of the novel coronavirus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only this, but COVID-19 has also severely disrupted the IT industry. Thousands of IT service providers are unable to adapt to the new remote working environments that have become mandatory owing to the nature of this pandemic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In understanding of the unprecedented circumstances we\u2019re in, ValueCoders has taken subsequent measures to adapt to the situation and we have enabled remote operations for all departments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>Presently, staff from all our Development teams, HR, IT, Sales, Project Management teams among all other crucial departments are working from home and advocating Social Distancing as per the Government Advisories.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, you must be wondering how our teams collaborate while working remotely? Let us give you a showdown on how we are coping during this time while working remotely round the clock.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Are_We_Practicing_Remote_Working_at_Home\"><\/span><strong>How Are We Practicing Remote Working at Home?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/it-outsourcing-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>IT outsourcing company<\/strong><\/a>, we already had corporate protocols for remote working set in place. That has helped us in setting up this new working environment for all our functioning departments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are working remotely using interactive, highly encrypted communication tools and platforms that help create an in-office environment in the comfort of home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ValueCoders has implemented all important measures to keep our team safe while helping them to be as productive as ever. Here are some steps we took towards our implementation:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Configuration of employees\u2019 personal devices for maximizing the security of sensitive business data:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have configured the personal computing devices of all our employees working from home to make sure they\u2019re protected from all cybersecurity threats. While there\u2019s not much we could do about the COVID-19 virus apart from social distancing, <\/span><i>our expert IT infrastructure and support team has done everything they could to protect our team and partners from the viruses that threaten their computer systems <\/i>and the valuable data stored inside them.<\/p>\n<p>For teams working on bigger &amp; more complex projects for which a personal laptop won\u2019t suffice- <i>we have provided them with specially configured desktops<\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that will let our expert teams deliver their best efforts, even from home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Ensuring timely deliverables\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our remote working environment, it is possible to keep a check on project timelines to ensure timely deliverable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>For this, we are using a handful of software tools to ensure timely delivery:<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>For Project Management<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Zoho<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Zoho is a powerful software suite for team collaboration on projects and certain tasks. We\u2019re using Zoho for task management across our development and marketing teams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>For Seamless Communication:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Microsoft Skype<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: We use skype to maintain seamless communication across all our teams through skype messenger, video and voice calls. An effective communication tool for our internal teams and client interactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Google Hangouts:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We are using Hangouts to implement the concept of Virtual rooms, while practicing social distancing, wherein teams can connect virtually, without missing the atmosphere of office premises.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>For Time Management:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Hubstaff:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With Hubstaff, we can not only track the time spent on any project. We can also use this software for instant billing and issuing of payments via online timesheets, employee scheduling, screen recording, employee monitoring, payroll software, GPS tracking, online invoicing, and project budgeting, and many more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Using Virtual Rooms to facilitate Social Distancing at a large scale:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term \u201csocial distancing\u201d seems a bit misleading when taken literally. In the present situation, what we really need to do is \u201cphysical distancing\u201d, to protect ourselves and everyone around us.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is what we have done already. But at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=home_13430&amp;utm_campaign=sme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ValueCoders<\/a>, there is and never will be such a thing as no social interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having an active social interaction is part of the ValueCoders\u2019 culture in our offices. We have tried to make a similar environment for our developers and other team members through virtual video conference rooms. These virtual rooms can be accessed by any of our team members through a video call.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Presently, virtual rooms are used to conduct occasional team meetings, daily SCRUM, team interactions, and client meetings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Wrapping_Up\"><\/span><strong>Wrapping Up<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Valuecoders, we are working as a team to combat this pandemic situation in rough times. To ensure the smooth functioning of our operations, we are collaborating with our internal teams on a daily basis to ensure business delivery at all levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are in it together to fight this pandemic at an earliest with our teams at adherence to support businesses during rough times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While practising Government Advisories, we are ensuring to look through business needs for custom software development, mobile application development or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/outsource-software-product-development-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>software product development<\/strong><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For business inquiries, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/contact?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=contact_13430&amp;utm_campaign=sme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contact<\/a> our business experts for a deeper understanding of your project requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together, we can do it!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has taken the world by storm.

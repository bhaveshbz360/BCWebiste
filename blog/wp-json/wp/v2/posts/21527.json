And the online banking apps consisted of many variables. There was some functionality of currency changes within the master admin panel, where the admin could change the currency value per SEN.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this led to the change in calculations within the application after getting it done. And the analysis was very complex, and our project management team understood the queries\/calculations and tackled them by closely coordinating the results with the client.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The application involves currency and payment transactions, so it was necessary to keep it as fully secure as possible. We used AWS EC2 Server with SSL Layer and Amazon S3 Server for Images to meet security demand.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has always been quite fun to deal with such kinds of situations. We are a group of talented professionals and developers who know how to tackle different aspects and problems while developing an app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To overcome some challenges, The team of ValueCoders used some <\/span>Banking Software Solutions<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and focused on developing the application with all the latest updates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Crafting Secure Online Payment Experiences <\/div>\n    <p>Discover How We Overcame Challenges to Ensure Your App's Safety! <\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\">\n    <a href=\" https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;amp;utm_medium=Ved_21527_a24&amp;amp;utm_campaign=webblogcontact \" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Contact Now<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"SOLUTION_IMPLEMENTED_BY_US\"><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED BY US<\/b><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><b>Requirement Analysis<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this particular segment, we try to gather every possible information from stakeholders and document the same.

Having proper documentation of what you need and achieving the target is always necessary for better results. We always have documentation to present directly to the client to understand the project better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Designing Phase<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing an app is like climbing a stair; you will face another challenge with one step up until you reach your destination. Similarly, after creating a wireframe, we move to the designing phase, in which our UX\/UI developers design every single module and theme color. Every module is interlinked with functionality having some dummy data in use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Execution Phase<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the designing part, our Backend developers develop all the initials API, and frontend developers integrate all available APIs with best practices making dynamic to all the screens.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Client Request Based Project Delivery<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving the best product to our client is our main motive, and just because of that, we constantly get in touch with the client after passing even a single module so that the client can check that and suggest anything more required. In this case also, while developing a <\/span>banking software application<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we connected with the client after passing every phase.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developers are connected in conversations with clients daily and follow their ideas or suggestions. In case of any feasibility challenge, developers give the alternative solution and try clients to be on the same phase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clients also mention the Jira and assign the task to developers as per their priority. This process helps us meet the client&#8217;s expectations in the best possible manner and ensure the timely delivery of the tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Deployment Phase<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all of that, in the deployment phase, we do the testing and see if the App is ready to use or not, and doing proper unit testing on a local machine merge with develop branch and deploying to the dev server helps us to know more about App.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If any issues are found, the developer&#8217;s team tries to find them out and resolve them before delivering the app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then we send PR (pull request) for the main branch that will be deployed on the live server after review.

So let\u2019s move further to know more about mobile app development, and it\u2019s time to develop\u2026<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_App_Development_Process_Key_Stages_to_Success\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">The App Development Process: Key Stages to\u00a0Success<\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Whether you\u2019re creating an app from scratch for building on an existing idea, the app development process has five main stages\u200a\u2014\u200aideation, design, testing, launching, and scaling\u200a\u2014\u200aallowing you to get your product to market quickly and with maximum effect.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Moreover, applications with diverse sizes and additional features have different app development times. Here, view\u200a\u2014\u200ahow much time it takes to build an app. The image placed below shows the estimated mobile app development time for each stage.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"graf-image aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/0*W6v5wmqAoDlIv0WG\" alt=\"mobile app development activity\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" data-image-id=\"0*W6v5wmqAoDlIv0WG\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"400\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"padding-left: 280px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Image Source: Excellent WebWorld<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you skip any of these stages or fail to complete them successfully, your app may be less competitive in the marketplace than it could be.

The best thing you can do is brainstorm as many ideas as possible you can\u200a\u2014\u200athere\u2019s no limit!<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you need help coming up with ideas, consider using resources like Quora or Reddit. Once you have a solid list of several <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/40-best-app-startup-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>app ideas<\/strong><\/a>, sort them into categories that make sense for your situation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, if you\u2019re looking to create an educational app for kids, it might be helpful to separate these apps by subject (math apps, science apps) and grade level. The more specific your idea is, the easier it will be to market later.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, if you\u2019re looking to create an educational app for kids, it might be helpful to separate these apps by subject (math apps, science apps) and grade level. The more specific your idea is, the easier it will be to market later.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Once you\u2019ve narrowed down which idea seems best suited for development as an application based on its potential usefulness and marketability, start thinking about what features should be included in your mobile application.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This stage can take several weeks or months, depending on how complex your app is. The more complex your app, the longer it will take you to get through these stages. For a simple idea, you might be able to go from idea generation to development in just a few days or weeks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you\u2019re creating an app with multiple features and a lot of content, you\u2019ll require more time for each step to ensure that everything goes smoothly.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--h4\">By the end of this step, you should get these outcomes:<\/h4>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Minimum Viable Product<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">User Stories<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">App Prototypes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Stage_2_Planning_it_all_out\"><\/span>Stage 2: Planning it all\u00a0out<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Your app will only be as good as its foundations. So, don\u2019t rush into development too soon! Take some time at stage 2 to plan your app and think through what it should offer, what it should look like, and why it is unique. This is all about having a solid idea of what you want your finished product to be.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You need a solid foundation on which you can build your app\u200a\u2014\u200aand you might find that some changes are needed further down the line for everything to run smoothly. So, take some time at stage 2 before proceeding into actual development\u200a\u2014\u200aor else you could find yourself starting over again in no time at all!<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you\u2019re wondering what goes into stage 2, there are a few things to take care of.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Firstly, think about how much money you want to make from your app. You need a solid financial plan for your business, including estimating your profit margins.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Secondly, think about how long does it take to build a mobile app and how much it will cost.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Thirdly start thinking about which platform, iOS or Android, you will prefer for your app development and which technology AI, IoT, Blockchain, or others you will incorporate to make your app amazing and unique.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">And lastly, start thinking about who you might be able to team up with\u200a\u2014\u200awhether they\u2019re programmers or designers, or people with other analytics and social media marketing skills.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So how long does it take to complete this stage of mobile app development? Well, that depends on your business plan. But you should be aiming for around three months if you want to get a basic version of your app up and running.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/top-mobile-app-development-frameworks-in-the-future-of-app-development\/\" rel=\"bookmark\">List Of Top Mobile App Development Frameworks: The Future of App Development<\/a><\/h4>\n<hr \/>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Stage_3_Design_Prototyping\"><\/span>Stage 3: Design &amp; Prototyping<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"graf-image aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/0*n-YAGUR3IudR2m3g\" alt=\"stages of mobile app\" width=\"800\" height=\"468\" data-image-id=\"0*n-YAGUR3IudR2m3g\" data-width=\"902\" data-height=\"528\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"padding-left: 280px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Image Source: ScienceSoft<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">With a working prototype, you will be able to gauge how your users interact with your product, test different design options, and ensure that various people can use it easily. A well-designed app is not only beautiful but also easy to navigate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You should also consider developing an app for both iOS and Android platforms at once. It\u2019s much easier (and cheaper) to develop an app for one platform first and then port it over than it is to create two separate apps from scratch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">During prototyping, you may want to bring in a professional designer or<a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/hire-developers\/hire-mobile-app-developers?utm_source=MobileAppdeveloper&amp;utm_medium=Anu_B11&amp;utm_id=MobileAppDevelopers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> hire mobile app developers\u200a<\/a>\u2014\u200abut don\u2019t do so until after testing out some designs on friends or family members who fit your target market.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This way, if they have trouble using your prototype or suggest changes based on their feedback, you won\u2019t have wasted money by bringing in outside help too early.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Before final app development, you will also want to finalize your app\u2019s features. You\u2019ll need a combination of key features that are popular and unique ones that make your app stand out from competitors.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Popular features include in-app chat, photo sharing, and push notifications; unique ones depend on your target market. If you have more than one key feature idea, choose just one or two and add others later if you find they are needed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The important thing is not to overload users with too many options or confuse them by providing duplicate functionality in different parts of your app.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This stage may take several weeks, depending on how many changes you make. However, the more iterations you go through; however, the more time you\u2019ll save in development and testing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, if it takes a week for each iteration of your prototype, but you need three iterations before moving on to app development, that\u2019s three weeks\u200a\u2014\u200aor nine weeks total.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">However, if it only takes one week per iteration and you need three iterations before moving on to app development, that\u2019s only three weeks\u200a\u2014\u200asaving six weeks!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Stage_4_Mobile_App_Development\"><\/span>Stage 4: Mobile App Development<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">During development, a talented developer takes your concept and gives it life. You\u2019ll usually have at least one face-to-face meeting per week to discuss details. This is where you work out any potential kinks in your idea and make sure everything from features to the user experience will be what you want it to be.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Sometimes these meetings feel like brainstorming sessions where you\u2019re throwing out ideas and seeing which ones stick; other times, things will feel more structured. Whatever happens, your mobile app developers should always give you solid feedback that lets you decide if an idea is worth pursuing or not.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The mobile app development stage mainly includes:<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Fron-end development<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong>Back-end development<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Front-end refers to a graphical user interface (GUI) that is more interactive and intuitive, making it easier for users to use. Moreover, front-end development includes an app\u2019s design, color scheme, logo and branding, animations or transitions between screens or menus, etc.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Back-end refers to how data is handled behind the scenes by developers. This includes processing information, storing data, integrating with other systems, etc.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The back-end of an application will be most important for business apps as they often require complex processes that must run smoothly for an app to work correctly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The development stage is one of the long stages in an app\u2019s life cycle. Depending on how complex your app is and how many developers you need to work on it, it can take a few months to a year or more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">During development, you\u2019ll want to check in with your developer regularly and make sure they\u2019re meeting all your expectations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If something isn\u2019t running right or if you have any questions, it\u2019s best to bring them up as soon as possible to work together on finding solutions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">To keep track of everything that happens during mobile app development, it helps to have a project manager who will be able to organize tasks and keep everyone involved updated on what\u2019s happening at all times.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Stage_5_Testing_Bug_Fixing_And_Submission\"><\/span>Stage 5: Testing, Bug Fixing, And Submission<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">After spending weeks or months building your app, you\u2019ll want it out into the real world as soon as possible. This stage is all about getting feedback on how it works and how you can improve it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You may even decide to make changes based on some of these ideas, though ultimately, most <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/hire-developers\/hire-mobile-app-developers?utm_source=MobileAppdeveloper&amp;utm_medium=Anu_B11&amp;utm_id=MobileAppDevelopers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mobile app developers<\/a> want to get their app onto as many devices as possible.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">There are a few ways you can do testing, including using beta testing sites like TestFlight and BetaBound. If you choose to take that route, remember to be open with users about what they\u2019re signing up for.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">They should know what kind of experience they can expect from an early version of your app and whether there will be bugs needing fixing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Also, keep in mind that once you submit your app for review, Apple has 30 days to approve it before it goes live in the App Store (unless there are significant issues). Moreover, if you\u2019re planning to launch an Android app, note that Google Play also has its submission process.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The good news is that Google tends to have a faster turnaround time than Apple does; however, it\u2019s also more challenging to get your app approved because Google doesn\u2019t let just any developer publish apps on its platform. In fact, only one percent of submissions make it through!<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In completion of this stage, several days to weeks will be spent testing, bug fixing, and submission. The time it takes for an app to go from development into beta testing and then finally onto app stores can vary greatly depending on each project. The more popular your app is expected to be, then the longer it may take for you to get it out there.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Stage_6_Monetization\"><\/span>Stage 6: Monetization<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Monetization occurs during production. The main ways to monetize an app include paid downloads, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. After launching your app, you will be able to see exactly how many downloads and in-app purchases you are getting, which can help you make future decisions regarding monetization.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You may also consider running a free trial for your app or offering a free version of it that contains adverts. This could help increase revenue from advertising and raise brand awareness for your business.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You should also consider employing Google Analytics to monitor user activity on your app and find out where they are dropping off when using it. This information can then be used to improve functionality within the app and make it more user-friendly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Suppose you have chosen not to offer any in-app purchases or ads with your product. You may want to consider selling it on a marketplace such as Apple\u2019s App Store or Google Play Store instead of creating an entirely new website for users to purchase from directly.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Factors_That_Usually_Slow_Down_The_Mobile_App_Development_Process\"><\/span>Factors That Usually Slow Down The Mobile App Development Process<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Here view the various factors that usually slow down or halt app development. These are some of the most common causes of delay in app development. And they are often effortless to avoid. So, let\u2019s take a glance at them one by one:<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Mid-project_Changes\"><\/span>Mid-project Changes<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Mid-project change is one of the most common causes of delay in app development. And it can occur at any stage of an app\u2019s lifecycle. For example, clients may decide that they want their app to do something else. Or maybe they want a new feature added in. This type of change can be pretty disruptive and add cost and time delays to your project.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The best way to detour these issues is through clear communication and good planning before developing your app. Agreeing on exactly what you are going to build before you start building will help assure that everyone is on board with any modifications made during development.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Unexperienced_Developers\"><\/span>Unexperienced Developers<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Another common cause of delay in app development is inexperienced mobile app developers. This can be a genuine concern if you choose a developer who doesn\u2019t have much experience in your field.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, if you are building an app for iOS and your developer has never developed an iOS app before. There is a good possibility that they will run into problems and delays during development.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You need to ensure that your developer has experience with whatever platform or technology you are using for your project. The same goes for any other specialist skills required for your project.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A great way to find out how experienced a potential developer is by checking their online portfolio and seeing what kind of work they have done in the past.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Complex_Technologies\"><\/span>Complex Technologies<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The complexity of your app can also have a significant impact on how long it takes to develop.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, creating an app that uses complex technologies like augmented reality or computer vision will take longer for your developer to complete. These apps require specialist skills and technology that most developers don\u2019t have.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This means they will need more time and resources to build them. It is worth noting that these apps are becoming more common, so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard for you to find a developer with experience.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/guide-to-android-app-development-tips-tricks-and-strategies-for-building-successful-apps\/\" rel=\"bookmark\">Guide to Android App Development: Tips, Tricks, and Strategies for Building Successful Apps<\/a><\/h4>\n<hr \/>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/h4>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Sprint_Up_The_Time_of_Application_Development\"><\/span>How to Sprint Up The Time of Application Development?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"graf-image aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/0*1mE4oqQKworqPbEt\" alt=\"mobile app development timeline\" width=\"800\" height=\"640\" data-image-id=\"0*1mE4oqQKworqPbEt\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"800\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The fastest way of application development is getting it from a real mobile app development company with good professionals working for them because they have all things under control.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You will have different types of apps at your disposal, and you can pick up which one works best for you. All in all, several things can be done to speed up application development in general and make it go more smoothly; some of them are:<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"MVPs_And_Prototyping\"><\/span>MVPs And Prototyping<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The idea of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is a very important one in speeding up mobile app development because it allows you to get something out there that real people can use. It will enable you to test your concept, find flaws, and fix them without spending too much time creating something that may not work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Prototyping is also important because it allows you to create an actual working version of your application that can be tested with real users before starting full-scale development. This will help you speed up things considerably and ensure that what you\u2019re doing makes sense.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hire_A_Professional_Developer\"><\/span>Hire A Professional Developer<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Many people think that they can do it all on their own and don\u2019t need help from others. However, if you want to speed up things, you should hire mobile app developers. Because they will get things done much faster than you would be able to do them.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Agile_Development\"><\/span>Agile Development<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This is another great way of speeding up mobile app development. It allows you to create a working version of your application as soon as possible. It also helps you test things out, make changes, and fix bugs quickly, which you need when trying to speed up things.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"White_Label_Solutions\"><\/span>White Label Solutions<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">When you\u2019re trying to speed up mobile app development, it\u2019s good to go with white label solutions. It is because they will allow you to get a working version of your application much faster.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A white label solution is an existing application that has been modified for something else.

First, you need to convert the business idea into a business plan and then put down what all you need from a successful product. Defining the technology with which you wish to develop your product is another crucial decision. This also helps in defining the skill levels of the teams you wish to hire. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the scope of the project is defined and the vendor for product development has been chosen, the service level agreement with the vendor can be created. <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This helps in ensuring that the outsourced teams are working according to the plan of action. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The outsourced teams must be clearly communicated about the expectations and the milestones.

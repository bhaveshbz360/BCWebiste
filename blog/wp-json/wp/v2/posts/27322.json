Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual tokens that use cryptography to secure their transactions and control the creation of new units. Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009. There are three primary types of blockchain: public, private, and hybrid. We are going to discuss all three types in this blog.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain technology, the engine behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has immense potential to change the world in ways we can\u2019t even imagine today. But how will blockchain impact our future? In this blog, we\u2019ll discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each type, as well as their applications outside the realm of cryptocurrency, including supply chain management and smart cities.

It constantly grows as &#8220;completed&#8221; blocks are added with a new set of recordings. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Bitcoin nodes use the blockchain to differentiate legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses <\/span>blockchain technology <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to track transactions. All transfers are recorded publicly in a database called a blockchain. To create bitcoin, users must complete a complex online process known as mining, which involves using computers to solve complex math problems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This process guarantees that bitcoins aren&#8217;t printed or minted to counterfeiters\u2014there&#8217;s only so much of it available. Bitcoin buyers pay for their coins by electronically transferring conventional currencies across exchanges, where they can buy and sell bitcoins at market prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Also Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/blockchain-ml\/cloud-computing-vs-blockchain-technology-which-is-right-for-your-business\/?utm_source=Organic+-+Valuecoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cloud Computing vs. Blockchain Technology: Which Is Right For Your Business?<\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_do_Blockchain_Works\"><\/span>How do Blockchain Works?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain technology uses a combination of cryptography and game theory to create a system of decentralized trust. Every blockchain comprises blocks organized into an immutable sequence. Each block contains two parts, the block header and the block content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The block header contains metadata, such as the previous block&#8217;s hash in the sequence, to prove that it follows from this one. The block content comprises transactions or other information participants share in a transaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important thing to remember is that blockchain technology isn\u2019t just about cryptocurrencies. It can build decentralized applications from currencies and voting systems to healthcare, insurance, and supply chain management systems. It\u2019s also worth noting that not all blockchains are private or public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/contact?utm_source=Organic+-+Valuecoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-17839 aligncenter\" title=\"blockchain development\" src=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/blockchain-development.jpg\" alt=\"blockchain development\" width=\"810\" height=\"152\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/blockchain-development.jpg 810w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/blockchain-development-300x56.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/blockchain-development-768x144.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_the_Uses_of_Blockchain\"><\/span>What are the Uses of Blockchain?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of potential uses for blockchain technology.

This type of blockchain is decentralized, meaning no central authority manages the network. Instead, the network is managed by all the users collectively.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is the best-known example of a public blockchain. Anyone can join the Bitcoin network and start participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem. There are no barriers to entry, and no one needs permission to join.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private blockchains are much more limited than public ones. Access to a private blockchain is typically restricted to institutions with permission to use it. The ledger is not as transparent because only a select few can view it. A blockchain may be private or public.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all depends on who can view it, who owns it and whether it&#8217;s centralized or decentralized. Below are the benefits of public blockchain technology:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is open to everyone, and no one controls them.

Moreover, the potential use for private blockchain technology is as a tool for identity management.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another use for private blockchain technology is for improving data integrity. For example, if you\u2019re an eCommerce platform that relies on third-party vendors to provide your products, you can use a private blockchain to verify inventory levels at each step in your supply chain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Public_Blockchain_Technology\"><\/span>Public Blockchain Technology<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private blockchains are often used for enterprise applications where the participants are known and trusted. Private blockchains can offer improved security and privacy over public blockchains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is often used for cryptocurrencies, where anyone can participate. Public blockchains offer censorship resistance and security through decentralization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, in a public blockchain, the whole world can see the transactions happening in the shared database. However, in a private or permissioned blockchain, transactions are only visible to those permitted by the node&#8217;s operator or through their unique cryptographic key (i.e., whitelisted).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blockchain-development-company?utm_source=Organic+-+Valuecoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blockchain Development Company<\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should always research before building it to ensure it will meet all of your needs going forward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if you have an idea for a blockchain app that stores names and social security numbers but would like people to access it anonymously, then you&#8217;ll probably want to hire blockchain developers with an understanding of cryptography.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Hybrid_Blockchain_Technology\"><\/span>Hybrid Blockchain Technology<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise, in a hybrid or permissionless system, some nodes are open for everyone to participate. Others require approval from one of the administrators before they become active on the network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hybrid blockchain technology is generally used for specific tasks or functions that are too private to share. For example, a hybrid blockchain can be created where two blockchains operate simultaneously.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One would be public, open, and accessible by anyone; the other would remain private, with limited access only available to those who have been granted permission.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same company might want one of its databases to be public so that everyone can see the list of all employees, but they may not want everyone to know what their payroll records look like, so they&#8217;ll use the second blockchain instead.\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A B<\/span>lockchain Development Company <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will help you set up the transaction between both blocks. You can also choose if either blockchain has moderators in charge of verifying transactions, updating new blocks into the chain, and deleting obsolete ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Also Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/top-and-best-companies\/top-blockchain-development-companies-to-improve-your-business-efficiency\/?utm_source=Organic+-+Valuecoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top Blockchain Development Companies to Improve Your Business Efficiency<\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_Side_Chains\"><\/span>What are Side Chains?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Side chains are blockchain networks that connect to the main chain. They are connected to the main chain through a two-way peg. A sidechain is a separate blockchain where units of value, or coins, are transferred between different blockchains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users can transfer their coins from the original blockchain to the sidechain and vice versa. This is achieved by locking up coins on one blockchain to mint new ones on another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the side chains&#8217; most prominent use cases is extending blockchain functionality. For example, Bitcoin\u2019s scaling issue can be addressed by moving transactions from its main chain into a sidechain.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shorter transaction time, enhanced privacy and asset tokenization are just a few examples of blockchain functionality that could be made possible through side-chain implementation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Private, public, and hybrid blockchains have unique benefits and drawbacks that make them suitable for different use cases. Private blockchains are great for companies or organizations that need to keep their data confidential.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public blockchains are better suited for applications that need to be decentralized. Hybrid blockchains combine the best of both worlds by allowing privacy and decentralization. Ultimately, your type of blockchain will depend on your specific needs.

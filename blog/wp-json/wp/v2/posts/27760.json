Focusing on your work while hopping from daily scrum to the next proposed sprint is difficult. Things can anytime go out of control if you don\u2019t have the perfect scrum tools in your hand.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">In a rapidly changing business landscape, it\u2019s more important than ever to adapt quickly to new challenges. That\u2019s where agile software development comes in. This methodology prioritizes flexibility and collaboration, allowing businesses to respond quickly to change.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">According to recent survey data collected by <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/1password.com\/\">AgileBits<\/a>, more than 50% of businesses that employ more than 100 people use agile methods. Hence, businesses of all sizes realize the benefits of agile software development, becoming an industry-standard in the modern business world.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">We hope that this blog will make it easy for you to decide and select the best software development methodology for your next project.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">But, before we start this journey, it would be wise to have a look at \u201cwhat is Agile\u201d?<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Agile_Software_Development_A_Brief\"><\/span>Agile Software Development: A\u00a0Brief<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27798 aligncenter\" title=\"Agile\" src=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Agile.jpg\" alt=\"Agile\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Agile.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Agile-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Agile-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If we go to the literal meaning of the word \u201cAgile,\u201d then it means\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cable to move quickly and easily.\u201d So, the same meaning goes here when we talk about agile regarding software development or project management.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile is a project management methodology primarily used by a custom software development company. It divides the whole task into multiple smaller tasks and combines them with the incremental &amp; short phases of work called sprints.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The main reason behind this approach is early and fast delivery, adaptive planning &amp; frequent reassessment, flexible response to change, and continuous improvement.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">According to <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/hygger.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/hygger.io\/\">Hygger<\/a>, \u201cagile projects are 28.0% more successful than traditional projects. Almost 86.0% of 101,5 international software developers use Agile in their work. 71.0% of surveyed companies admitted to using Agile approaches sometimes or always.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Now, I think you have got an idea of Agile, let\u2019s move further.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Also Read: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/agile-vs-waterfall-which-software-methodology-is-best-for-your-business\/\" rel=\"bookmark\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Agile Vs Waterfall: Which Software Methodology is Right for your Business?<\/a><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Do_Modern_Businesses_Need_Agile_Software_Development\"><\/span>Why Do Modern Businesses Need Agile Software Development?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/agile-consulting?utm_source=agile_consulting&amp;utm_medium=9+Reasons+Agile+&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=27760_nky\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agile software development<\/a> is here to stay. It is becoming increasingly popular as more businesses realize this approach\u2019s benefits. In today\u2019s fast-paced business world, agility is key. It provides organizations with thethe flexibility and adaptability to compete.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The traditional waterfall approach to software development can often be too slow and inflexible for modern businesses. Agile development teams can work in short sprints to deliver software responsive to changes. This helps businesses avoid the costly and time-consuming process of making major changes to software that has already been developed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile development also encourages collaboration between different teams, which helps ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goal. By using agile development, businesses can be more efficient and productive and better compete in today\u2019s market.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Does_It_Work_For_Seamless_Software_Development\"><\/span>How Does It Work For Seamless Software Development?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27799 aligncenter\" title=\"Agile System Development Life Cycle\" src=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Agile-System-Development-Life-Cycle.jpg\" alt=\"Agile System Development Life Cycle\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Agile-System-Development-Life-Cycle.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Agile-System-Development-Life-Cycle-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Agile-System-Development-Life-Cycle-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile methodology helps teams to deliver software development projects more seamlessly. Breaking down the project into smaller pieces allows for flexible and easier project management.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">The Agile process is typically divided into four distinct steps:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">1. Planning and requirements gathering<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It is the first step in the process and involves understanding what the customer wants from the project. This step is essential in ensuring that the final product meets the customer\u2019s needs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">2. Development<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It is the second step in the process and involves coding the software according to the specifications gathered in the first step. This step is essential in ensuring that the software functions correctly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">3. Testing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It is the third step in the process and involves testing the software to ensure that it meets the specifications gathered in the first step. This step is vital in ensuring that the software is high quality and meets customer needs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">4. Deployment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It is the fourth and final step in the process and involves putting the software into production. This step is important in ensuring that the software is available to the customer.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">By following these four steps, Agile methodology helps teams to deliver software development projects more seamlessly.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/okbAA5pySBw?si=Br1iwLW1O95t6WBg\" width=\"1080\" height=\"520\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Top_9_Advantages_Of_Agile_Software_Development_For_Modern_Businesses\"><\/span>Top 9 Advantages Of Agile Software Development For Modern Businesses<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile software development has many advantages for modern businesses. It helps businesses respond quickly to market changes, save money by reducing the need for rework, improve customer satisfaction levels, and improve their competitiveness.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Empowers Employees<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Teams are empowered to decide how their work will be accomplished, their tools, and who their customers are. Employees feel a sense of ownership over the product and know they can make changes if needed. Plus, because teams are self-organizing, employees learn new skills and gain experience in areas outside their expertise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Builds Trust with Customers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile software development ensures that the customer is not forgotten and their needs are considered throughout.

This makes agile development ideal for fast-paced, ever-changing business environments.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Promotes Continuous Learning<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile software development is a collaborative process. There will be disagreements and arguments between team members. The key to agile software development is that it helps teams resolve disagreements quickly and efficiently. Ultimately, the best idea wins because all team members are equally invested.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Better Communication Leads<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Communication is key when it comes to software development. A team that communicates well will work more efficiently and effectively. With agile methodology, regular meetings and standups help with this communication. Regular testing also helps identify bugs in the software before they become a major problem.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Not only does this save time and money, but it improves overall customer satisfaction by providing better quality assurance. Other advantages include faster feedback loops, better management of risk, and improved ability to respond to change.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Greater efficiency<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile development teams are typically more efficient than traditional waterfall teams since they can deliver working software incrementally and get feedback from users early and often.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Enhanced transparency<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile development teams are more open and transparent than traditional teams, making it easier for stakeholders to see the project\u2019s progress and offer feedback.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Increased stakeholder engagement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile development teams typically involve stakeholders more often and at a deeper level than traditional teams, which leads to greater buy-in and ownership of the final product.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Faster time to market<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile teams can quickly adapt to changes and deliver working solutions incrementally, which means agile projects can get to market faster than traditional waterfall projects.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Lower risk<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Agile teams deliver working software early and often, reducing the project\u2019s overall risk. Additionally, agile teams are typically more responsive to changes, reducing risk.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Encourages Feedback from All Roles<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">The collaborative nature of agile software development ensures that feedback from all roles is encouraged and welcomed, which leads to better decisions. Feedback can come in many forms, including through informal conversations with team members or formal meetings, but the key is that it\u2019s encouraged constructively.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One way to encourage feedback is by setting up regular retrospectives where team members discuss what went well and what didn\u2019t go so well in their work. And, because agile software development typically involves shorter projects, feedback loops are often tighter than they would be with waterfall-style processes.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let\u2019s Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Get free consultation and let us know your project idea to turn it into an amazing digital product.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\">\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/contact\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Talk To Our Experts<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div><\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--h3\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Some_Popular_Agile_Development_Tools\"><\/span>Some Popular Agile Development Tools<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">JIRA<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-27801 aligncenter\" title=\"JIRA\" src=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/JIRA.jpg\" alt=\"JIRA\" width=\"800\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/JIRA.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/JIRA-300x141.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/JIRA-768x360.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">JIRA is a light web-based agile tool for Bug tracking and management.

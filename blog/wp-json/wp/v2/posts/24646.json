Software development refers to a collection of software engineering activities performed by a software developer with varying levels of expertise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">These include requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and deployment. By outsourcing these functions to qualified third parties\u200a\u2014\u200ain locations such as India, Eastern Europe, or Latin America\u200a\u2014\u200acompanies can reduce overhead while freeing up existing employees to focus on core business processes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Over time, most IT projects have become increasingly complex and therefore expensive due to increases in size, scope, and organizational complexity. As a result, IT spending has risen faster than other parts of corporate budgets since 2002.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Because IT resources tend to make up 10% or less of total corporate expenses, some CIOs have decided that software development outsourcing provides better value than keeping those resources within an organization because it reduces IT expenses without sacrificing quality control or security standards.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/outsourcing-and-off-shoring\/choosing-the-right-fit-in-house-outsourced-or-freelance-software-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Choosing The Right Fit: In-House, Outsourced, Or Freelance Software Development<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 class=\"graf graf--p\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Do_Companies_Outsource_Software_Development\"><\/span>Why Do Companies Outsource Software Development?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"graf-image aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/0*iGr9i2l9c-4KahQu\" alt=\"Why Do Companies Outsource Software Development?\" width=\"800\" height=\"328\" data-image-id=\"0*iGr9i2l9c-4KahQu\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"657\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Image Source: <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Analysis+%E2%80%93+An+Overview+of+Software+Development+Outsourcing%3A&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjMmaW0qtf3AhXUgGMGHdLeDlEQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=Analysis+%E2%80%93+An+Overview+of+Software+Development+Outsourcing%3A&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1CGB1iGB2CLCmgAcAB4AIABgQGIAfQBkgEDMC4ymAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=Wpx7YsyENNSBjuMP0r27iAU&amp;bih=948&amp;biw=1848#imgrc=71uC83OCdlBpeM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=Analysis+%E2%80%93+An+Overview+of+Software+Development+Outsourcing%3A&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjMmaW0qtf3AhXUgGMGHdLeDlEQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=Analysis+%E2%80%93+An+Overview+of+Software+Development+Outsourcing%3A&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1CGB1iGB2CLCmgAcAB4AIABgQGIAfQBkgEDMC4ymAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=Wpx7YsyENNSBjuMP0r27iAU&amp;bih=948&amp;biw=1848#imgrc=71uC83OCdlBpeM\">Google<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">To succeed in today\u2019s digital world, it is not enough for companies to have great ideas.

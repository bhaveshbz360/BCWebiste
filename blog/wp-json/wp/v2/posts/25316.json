The app\u2019s size and complexity, the development team\u2019s experience, and even the tools and technologies are crucial in building a web app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research shows that the average time to develop a web app is around 18 weeks. This includes the time it takes to build, test, and launch the app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, this is just an average. Some apps can be built in weeks, while others can take months or even years to develop. Moreover, it will depend on the factors discussed above.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing to remember is that the development process is often iterative. The team builds a version of the app, tests it, finds problems, and then goes back and fixes them.

The web development team works to understand the project\u2019s scope and identify the requirements. This phase can take a few weeks to months, depending on the size and complexity of the app.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Phase 2: Design and Development<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the planning and discovery phase, it\u2019s time to start designing and developing the app. It is typically the most prolonged project phase and can take several months to complete.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Phase 3: Testing and Launch<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the app is designed and developed, it\u2019s time for testing.

Creating an interactive web application for Facebook, Twitter, or another popular platform requires other programming languages and design philosophies than building an enterprise business application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing what software and tools your team will use significantly reduces costs but also risks causing delays if everyone isn\u2019t well versed in them yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Duration between planning and implementation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s a vast chasm of time! Most plans are strategic and vague, mostly high-level initiatives. After you start implementing your plan, you realize you need more attention.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get through your business plan as quickly as possible, focus on only the things essential for immediate action.

If you select an obscure or less common programming language, you\u2019ll need to find web app developers with experience in that language. This process can delay launch time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By contrast, more popular programming languages (like PHP) are more accessible for developers to learn independently\u2014meaning you can hire independent contractors more quickly and at less cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Development team size and experience<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before developing a new product or service, one of your primary considerations is how many people you need on your team and what qualifications they should have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are some guidelines for working with developers (for example, you\u2019ll want someone who knows Ruby on Rails if you\u2019re building an iOS app), it all depends on what product or service you want to develop.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Test coverage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Test coverage is integral to quality assurance, but you can\u2019t test your product to death. Focus on finding bugs at all stages of development; don\u2019t be afraid to do exploratory testing or think about how you would use your product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With time, you\u2019ll get a feel for how much thoroughness is required in each stage and how much time you need to allocate for thorough testing. At any rate, it pays off to over-test; bugs found during QA are more manageable (and cheaper) than bugs found once live.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Quality requirements<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s tempting to skimp on product quality, especially when racing against time or keeping costs low. However, sound quality isn\u2019t something you should scrimp on when building your product; it will only cause more headaches in later stages of development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, suppose your application needs constant bug fixes because of poor code quality, or you spend hours upon hours debugging and making edits due to inadequate specifications. In that case, you\u2019ll find yourself with limited time for final user testing and overall marketing efforts\u2014leaving you with little success in launching your product.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent headaches, implement a high-quality process from start to finish.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/top-web-application-development-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"bookmark noopener\">Top 10 Web Application Development Trends\u00a0<\/a><\/h4>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Web_App_Development_Timeline_And_Stages_A_Complete_Overview\"><\/span><b>Web App Development Timeline And Stages (A Complete Overview)<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25324 \" title=\"unnamed 2\" src=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/unnamed-2.png\" alt=\"Web app development company\" width=\"628\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/unnamed-2.png 512w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/unnamed-2-300x158.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" \/><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Ideation &amp; Planning<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The \u201cIdeation and planning\u201d stage in web application development is about developing ideas and planning how to turn those ideas into reality.

You also better understand your project\u2019s scope and what will be required to bring it to life.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some things to keep in mind during the Ideation and planning stage if you\u2019re working on a web app development project:<\/p>\n<p>Define the purpose of your web app. What are you trying to achieve with it?<br \/>\nIdentify your target audience. Who will be using your web app?<br \/>\nSketch out the critical features of your web app. What will it be able to do?<br \/>\nCreate a roadmap for development. What steps will you need to take to build your web app?<br \/>\nConduct market research. Is there a demand for your web app? Are there any similar products already on the market?<br \/>\nMake sure you have the necessary resources in place. Do you have the skills and knowledge required to develop your web app? Do you have access to the right tools and technologies?<br \/>\nCreate a budget and timeline for your project. How much money do you have to spend on development? How long do you have to get the web app up and running?<\/p>\n<p>By carefully planning out your web and app development project, you\u2019ll be setting yourself up for success.

This usually involves creating mockups and wireframes to create a working app model. The prototype can test various aspects of the app, such as usability and functionality. Once the prototype is complete, it works as a template for developing the actual web app.<\/p>\n<p>The first step in design and prototyping is to create a wireframe. A wireframe is a high-level app blueprint showing the overall layout and structure. It determines the placement of elements on each page and establishes the navigation flow between pages. Wireframes can be created using paper and pencil or with specialized software such as Balsamiq Mockups.<\/p>\n<p>Once the wireframe is complete, it can be used to create mockups. Mockups are more detailed versions of the wireframe that show how the app will look and feel. They can be made using Photoshop, Sketch, or other similar software.<\/p>\n<p>After developing mockups, an app prototype is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or Adobe XD. Thoroughly test the prototype to ensure every aspect of the app works properly.<\/p>\n<p>Once the prototype is complete, it works as a template for developing the actual web app. This involves coding the frontend and backend of the app and integrating it with any third-party services that are needed. Once the web app is complete, it should be tested thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly.<\/p>\n<p>Design and prototyping allow you to create a working app model before coding it. This saves a lot of time and effort, enabling you to test various aspects of the app before making any changes to the code. The prototype should be as close to the final product as possible to work as a template for development.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Development &amp; Testing<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>This is where you start building the web app, including coding and testing it to ensure everything works.<\/p>\n<p>The development stage is where you\u2019ll build the web app. This involves both backend development (coding the functionality of the web app) and frontend development (designing the user interface and interactivity).<\/p>\n<p>Frontend development is responsible for the client-side of web application development and focuses on creating the application\u2019s user interface and visual elements.<\/p>\n<p>Backend development refers to the server-side of web app development and is responsible for housing the data and business logic of the application. This includes developing APIs to access data, as well as coding the functionality of the web app itself.<\/p>\n<p>Once the web app is built, it\u2019s essential to test it thoroughly to ensure everything works as it should. Finally, once the web app is complete and thoroughly tested, you can deploy it for others. This stage involves setting up the web server and database (if needed) and ensuring the web app is accessible to everyone using it.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Also Read: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-a-mobile-app\/\" rel=\"bookmark\">How Long Does It Take to Build a Mobile App<\/a><\/h4>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><b>Launch and Ongoing Maintenance<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>After completing your web app\u2019s development, it\u2019s time to launch it.

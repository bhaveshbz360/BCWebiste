These components are the building blocks of Angular apps that encapsulate the app&#8217;s logic and presentation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can make your angular app more modular, scalable, reusable, and easy to maintain by organizing these apps&#8217; logic into smaller and more focused components. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/hire-developers\/hire-angularjs-developers?utm_source=ValueCoders+-+Scaling-apps-with-angular-29747&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hire AngularJS Developers<\/a> from a top Angular development company in India to easily perform these tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/ecommerce-cms\/how-did-we-create-an-ecommerce-web-solution-in-just-3-days\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How ValueCoders Developed An E-Commerce Trading Website Application Using Angular?<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Lazy_Loading\"><\/span><b>Lazy Loading<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Angular provides a very easy way to lazy-load resources using the built-in Angular Router. Lazy loading is a technique that allows you to load parts of your application only when they are needed, which can significantly reduce the initial load time of your app. Instead of loading all the resources at once, lazy loading allows you to load resources on-demand as the user navigates through the app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Angular, you can use the loadChildren property of the Angular Router to lazy-load modules. This property specifies the module that should be loaded lazily when the corresponding route is activated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, suppose you have an admin module that you want to load lazily when the user navigates to the &#8220;\/admin&#8221; route. You can define this route in your app&#8217;s routing module as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copy code<\/span><\/p>\n<p><code>{<br \/>\npath: 'admin',<br \/>\nloadChildren: () =&gt; import('.\/admin\/admin.module').then(m =&gt; m.AdminModule)<br \/>\n}<br \/>\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This code imports the &#8220;AdminModule&#8221; lazily when the &#8220;\/admin&#8221; route is activated. The &#8220;AdminModule&#8221; will be loaded only when the user navigates to this route and not before.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Architecture_Design_Patterns\"><\/span><b>Architecture &amp; Design Patterns<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A well-designed architecture provides a solid foundation that supports the growth and evolution of the application over time, making it easier to add new features and functionality while maintaining the stability of the app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This provides a solid foundation that supports growth, modularity, scalability, maintainability, and ease of development, making it easier to build and maintain a large, complex application over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Watch this video &#8211; you will have a better understanding of how to build high-performance Angular apps that provide a seamless user experience.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Increase Angular App Performance | Let&#039;s Optimize Angular Apps With ValueCoders (SECRET TIPS)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/q9WRCjFYjZg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Use_of_Change_Detection\"><\/span><b>Use of Change Detection<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An angular application is a tree of components where each component has its &#8220;ChangeDetectorRef&#8221; provider.

It helps simplify the synchronization of data between the model and the view. Thus, it can build complex applications with many components and interactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Types of data binding in Angular:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Interpolation<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through interpolation, components can express the value of their properties within the template, indicated by two curly braces ({}). This is a convenient way to display text, numbers, or any primitive data type in the view.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Property binding<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using property binding, you can specify the value of a component&#8217;s properties, such as style, class, and attributes, in the template. This one-way data binding technique is denoted by square brackets ([ ]).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Event binding<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Event binding permits the reaction of a component to an event occurring in the view, such as a button press, via the usage of parentheses (()). This one-way data binding allows the monitoring of events in the view, enabling the corresponding method to be called within the component.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Two-way binding<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two-way binding allows a user to view and update the value of a component&#8217;s property at the same time.

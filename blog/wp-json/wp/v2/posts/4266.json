Therefore, application support and maintenance services appear to be a primary concern to get things going. Now, you must be thinking, why should you do that? Well, let\u2019s dive deep, then.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Think About The Following Issues<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Who takes care of your website, software, and apps when they crash?<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Who resolves the issue when they catch a bug?<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Do you update your website, software, or apps at the right time?<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">What will you do when your Website gets hacked?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> outsource a good IT company<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to develop their applications, but they forget about the app maintenance or do not care about it after creating the app. Ultimately, this results in business loss as the app stops functioning and engaging customers like it was previously doing. So focus more on Application Maintenance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">So, What Is Application Maintenance?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software Application Maintenance<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is just the same as that of your car servicing.

There are many models for application maintenance, but it&#8217;s an ongoing process with a strong relationship between the business and IT team members.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The model may vary with different app types or systems that you have to keep updated for optimum performance. Let&#8217;s discuss different \u200cmodels for application maintenance practices:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Onsite Model\/ On-Premise Solution: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This model involves allocating resources to manage servers and other IT infrastructure that business organizations use on-premises. This works well when there is no predetermined service level agreement with the provider.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>On Cloud Model\/SaaS Solution: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This model is used to deploy SAAS on the cloud, which includes allocating resources for IT infrastructure externally that third-party providers manage &amp; business organizations use it just like they use any other internet services (emails or social media account). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It works well when there is a predetermined service level agreement with the provider.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Managed Model\/MSP Solution:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In this model, business organizations allocate resources for IT infrastructure and keep it managed by providers or third-party professionals skilled in handling such services on the cloud.

Let&#8217;s see what happens if you stick solely to using Salesforce for your processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>File size:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In Salesforce, you can upload documents using two options: &#8220;Attachments,&#8221; which supports files up to 25 MB, and &#8220;File,&#8221; which allows files up to 2 GB. However, managing data larger than this can lead to higher storage costs and slow down system performance over time due to the platform&#8217;s multitenant architecture.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Real-time syncing:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Changes made on users&#8217; local drives don&#8217;t automatically sync with Salesforce files, and vice versa. Users must upload or download files and then replace them with the new version, as no real-time syncing option is available.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Document accessibility and privacy:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Salesforce documents can only be accessed by non-Salesforce users through a public URL, which raises concerns about GDPR compliance and other data security laws due to the public sharing of documents. One solution is to purchase additional licenses for non-Salesforce users, which can be costly.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>In another scenario, businesses might use Salesforce and SharePoint separately without integrating them. This approach has problems.<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Inefficient process:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Contracts for vendors, customers, and partners often follow the same approval process, which is usually automated within a single workflow management system like SharePoint. However, when it comes to approving contracts, Salesforce users must switch between CRM and SharePoint and vice versa.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Document duplication:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It is another issue when Salesforce isn&#8217;t integrated with SharePoint. Typically, the sales team needs to download documents from SharePoint and then upload them to Salesforce whenever they need to share them with their team or clients. This often results in having the same document stored in two systems, causing confusion with file versions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Glitchy team collaboration:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Team collaboration becomes challenging when customer records are stored in Salesforce, but collaboration occurs across both SharePoint and Salesforce. This leads to Salesforce users spending time switching between systems to stay connected with their teams, causing inefficiencies.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Content desertion:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Content abandonment occurs when sales teams copy links to SharePoint files in Salesforce but cannot preview or locate them using Salesforce&#8217;s global search. Consequently, valuable content for customer communication ends up buried within SharePoint libraries.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we&#8217;ve explored the drawbacks of not integrating SharePoint and Salesforce, let&#8217;s understand the clear benefits of establishing integration before we proceed to the integration steps.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/top-and-best-companies\/top-salesforce-development-service-provider\/\">Top Salesforce Development Service Providers For Businesses In 2024<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Benefits_of_Integrating_SharePoint_and_Salesforce\"><\/span><b>Benefits of Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integrating SharePoint&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/document-management-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">document management system<\/a> with Salesforce offers significant advantages to businesses aiming to enhance collaboration between service and sales teams while efficiently managing data.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce&#8217;s combined features as a CRM and SharePoint&#8217;s document management and file storage platform work together seamlessly, benefiting businesses greatly.<\/span><br \/>\n<b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-40489 aligncenter\" title=\"Benefits of Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce\" src=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce.jpg\" alt=\"Benefits of Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce\" width=\"800\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-300x113.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-768x290.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-480x181.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Enhanced Teamwork<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce improves collaboration not only among sales and service teams but also across departments like marketing and legal. Let&#8217;s explore the benefits of customizing Salesforce with some examples. For instance, picture a situation where a sales executive and a content writer collaborate on crafting a client proposal. With Salesforce integrated with SharePoint, any edits made by the sales executive to the writer&#8217;s document will instantly show up for all team members with access to the document. This ensures everyone stays updated and minimizes the chance of version control issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example is, suppose a legal team examines and approves a contract stored in SharePoint. Once approved, the sales executive can immediately see these changes in Salesforce. This ensures the sales team stays informed when communicating important updates to clients.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Improved System Performance<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A major advantage of integrating Salesforce with SharePoint is the enhancement in load balancing. Using each platform separately can strain the systems, resulting in more downtime and slower performance. However, integrating them allows for sharing data and files between the two platforms, leading to better load balancing and eliminating resource wastage from duplications and managing multiple copies.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Analytics and Reporting<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integrating SharePoint with Salesforce makes analytical and reporting tasks simpler. Data from both platforms can be merged to gain insights into sales performance, document usage, and customer interactions. For instance, using the SharePoint Online Reporting and Auditing tool, teams can analyze frequently accessed documents in the sales process. This provides valuable insights into the resources that have the greatest impact on closing deals or addressing customer issues.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Enhanced Document Security<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integrating Salesforce with SharePoint provides businesses with access to SharePoint&#8217;s strong security features, such as teams, roles, and permission levels. This helps them comply with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Additionally, the platform allows setting expiration dates for specific files, ensuring that third-party vendors cannot access the file after the expiration date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These four are just the main benefits of Salesforce Sharepoint integration. On a more practical level, there are several other advantages that emerge in day-to-day processes and workflows, including external sharing controls, enhanced data management, increased productivity, and scalability.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Seamlessly Sync Your Salesforce and SharePoint Data!<\/div>\n    <p>Ensure data consistency and accessibility across platforms with our comprehensive synchronization solutions.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\">\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;amp;utm_medium=Ved_40484_a24&amp;amp;utm_campaign=webblogcontact\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Request Demo<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The likelihood of experiencing these benefits in your organization hinges on how effectively you execute Salesforce SharePoint integration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before getting into that section, let&#8217;s provide a quick overview of the four guiding principles that can ensure the success of the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Key_Principles_for_Integrating_SharePoint_and_Salesforce\"><\/span><b>Key Principles for Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the current digital economy, successful integrations are vital for creating a productive and efficient organization.

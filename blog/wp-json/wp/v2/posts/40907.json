Some commonly used tools include Burp Suite, Mob SF, Nikto, Owasp Zap, APK tool, and Frida. Businesses can ensure that any vulnerabilities found are addressed promptly by regularly scheduling and performing these assessments. To effectively scan for the latest security flaws, it&#8217;s important to use an updated vulnerability database. Vulnerability scanners assess web applications externally to detect issues like cross-site scripting, SQL injections, command injections, insecure server configurations, and more.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #05164d;\"><b>4. Source Code Review<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source code review is an essential aspect of creating secure software, making it a vital type of security testing. Its goal is to uncover and address security weaknesses in an application&#8217;s source code. This proactive method ensures that security is a top priority in the software&#8217;s design, minimizing the risk of security breaches and data leaks. In a source code review, a skilled security analyst or developer meticulously examines the code, line by line, to pinpoint any security flaws, coding errors, or vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #05164d;\"><b>5.

This testing approach combines automated and manual methods to find vulnerabilities. It&#8217;s useful because it can detect problems without needing to run the software in a live environment. Engineers can carefully review the software source code audit and systematically address any security issues they find. SAST tools can delve deep into the code, uncovering vulnerabilities that might be missed by manual inspection.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Also read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/web-application-security-best-practices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Web Application Security Best Practices<\/a><\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #05164d;\"><b>6.

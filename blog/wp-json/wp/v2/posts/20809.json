However, the question is how eCommerce is going to acquire benefits from the service of PWAs. Since its arrival in 2015, PWAs have been adopted by a number of eCommerce giants such as Alibaba and Walmart. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Increased conversion rates and revenue growth are the major benefits acquired by these organizations. That&#8217;s the reason both small and medium eCommerce businesses are looking to embrace PWA technology to provide customers with an app-like experience on the website and extend interaction. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Surely, you would be having several questions looming in your head, such as what are PWA? How can they benefit the eCommerce business? And so on. Let&#8217;s find answers.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p align=\"left\"><div class=\"cust-secton1 padd-all margin-40\">\n    <div class=\"dis-flex\">\n    <div class=\"colleft\">\n    <div class=\"pb-heading\">Let\u2019s Discuss Your Project<\/div>\n    <p>Get free consultation and let us know your project idea to turn it into an amazing digital product.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"colrit\">\n    <div class=\"text-center btn-container\">\n    <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/contact\" class=\"banner-btn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_self\">Talk To Our Experts<i class=\"cusarrow-icon\"><\/i><\/a>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <\/div><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 align=\"left\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_are_PWAs\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><b>What are PWAs?<\/b><\/span><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There is no rocket science behind the progressive web app (PWA). Succinctly, PWAs are website applications at the core that work with the latest web capabilities to deliver a native app-like experience to users. The major perk of these applications is consistency between web and native applications. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Native applications are coveted for delivering a richer user experience than a web application. To mend the gap between native and web applications, the development of Progressive web apps arrived in the market. Overall, PWAs behave like native apps such as: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Steady and Faster Processing<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Smart Home Screen<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Push Notification<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Even Offline Operations<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-20813\" src=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/fdfdasfda.png\" alt=\"progressive web apps\" width=\"630\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/fdfdasfda.png 760w, https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/fdfdasfda-300x189.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">All of these features are extended from native application architecture. Businesses can cater to native-like app experience with web applications by subscribing to PWAs. Moreover, the biggest advantage of creating a PWA is users don&#8217;t need to download and install the app. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">PWAs are readily available on the web and run on browsers. Moreover, you don&#8217;t need to hire developers with some extra coding language experience, as progressive web apps develop via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Moreover, progressive web app developers can also leverage platforms like VuePress and Gatsby that can be connected to eCommerce platforms. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Sooner or later, PWAs may replace native apps, as a Jaxenter survey found that 46% of developers assert that PWAs are the future, while 14% think that native mobile apps will prevail. For some eCommerce businesses, native applications can be preferable. However, for small and medium-sized businesses, PWA can be a better choice than native app development. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As PWA technology is expanding and gaining more traction among businesses, it can be a tech for headless commerce configuration, which means decoupling frontend presentation from backend features. Having a PWA front end means simply subscribing to a faster, responsive app-like web experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">So, do you have some second thoughts regarding what PWAs?

Besides, the native-like app experience inspires users to visit the application again and again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">As I mentioned above, the customer engagement and conversion rate is higher on PWAs than on the native app. This is all because of fast, secure, reliable, and browser-agnostic properties. Besides, these apps are created in a small fraction of the time and cost it takes to develop a native mobile application. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Furthermore, PWAs are revolutionary in the eCommerce industry.

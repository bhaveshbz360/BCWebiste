Many firms, startups, SMEs, and big brands are opting Vue because of its firm foundation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is the list of the top factors that make Vue.js a great choice in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/vue-vs-react-which-one-to-choose\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Vue vs React<\/strong><\/a> vs Angular<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> war:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Virtual-DOM<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike other JavaScript frameworks like Angular and React, it\u2019s engineered to work incrementally in any environment. If you have an existing HTML page that uses jQuery, it\u2019s possible to convert it and see the performance increase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What makes using a virtual DOM so powerful is that your changes are local and do not affect other sections of your Vue application. This is a huge benefit for refactoring existing projects or testing out new features without affecting old ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Seamless Integration With React<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vue\u2019s official integration with React allows developers to use whatever they\u2019re most comfortable with for front-end libraries and frameworks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who prefer React, there\u2019s no need to spend a lot of time switching tools or learning something new, but if you already know Vue, you don\u2019t have to worry about falling behind on its features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These integrations make it much easier for team developers to work together more efficiently.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Clear and Concise Syntax<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developers spend a lot of time writing code to perform simple tasks (managing state, handling events, etc.) when creating an application. This can be minimized with a concise syntax that allows you to write less code while accomplishing more complex operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s no wonder why JavaScript has experienced explosive growth over recent years\u2014its small learning curve and seamless integration with other libraries make it easy for any developer to pick it up quickly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Data Binding<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of Vue\u2019s most attractive features is its ability to seamlessly and effortlessly bind data with no JavaScript configuration\u200c.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This feature frees developers from writing boilerplate code every time an application needs to update a DOM element, allowing you to focus on what makes your app unique instead of spending hours just wiring up functionality.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Flexible Code Structure<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vue is incrementally adaptable, and it can be used in various projects, regardless of whether you\u2019re using other libraries or frameworks alongside it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can fit into any codebase that uses HTML for templating and CSS for styling, making it highly flexible and easy to learn or port from other frameworks to use in tandem with other libraries or tools like Nuxt, Firebase, Serverless framework, and more!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/hire-developers\/hire-vuejs-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>hire VueJS developers<\/strong><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you want to make a unique and attractive web application for your corporation.

In MVC, your application is separated into three distinct parts: models, views, and controllers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Models manage data, view display data, and handle user input, and controllers handle communication between models and views.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By separating these three responsibilities into their modules, you can more easily develop your application by concentrating on one aspect at a time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Less Code Framework<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One reason for JavaScript\u2019s widespread adoption is that it\u2019s such a versatile language. It works on both client and server, in web browsers, and as a back-end language for APIs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For frontend development, we can use it with other languages like TypeScript to build richer apps and libraries. On mobile platforms, frameworks built on JavaScript have opened up a new world of options for designers and developers alike.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Efficient Two-Way Data Binding<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two-way data binding built into Angular means that every time your view changes, it automatically updates any bound data behind it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The framework creates a bridge between your JavaScript code and your HTML code. This way\u200c , when one side of your application changes, everything else is updated.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>CDK and Angular Material<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re doing any application development with Angular, you\u2019ve probably heard about Material Design.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Material Design is a language formed by Google that helps guide developers when building applications for Android devices. One part of Material Design is a UI library called Angular Material.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Angular CLI<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking to create an Angular app, but don\u2019t want to deal with setting up a complex environment and configuring tools such as Webpack, Grunt, or Gulp, look no further than using Angular CLI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will help you quickly scaffold new projects and provide various commands for building, testing, and deploying your application.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Cons_of_using_Angular\"><\/span><strong>Cons of using Angular<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AngularJS is a robust framework that can do a lot, but it also has some drawbacks:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Large Size<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AngularJS is an extensive framework that can slow down page load times and make development more difficult. Moreover, it is not as modular as React or Vue. Hence, it can be more difficult to use only the parts of the framework you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Opinionated<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being opinionated, Angular follows a specific set of conventions and patterns for building web applications. This includes using TypeScript, a strict superset of JavaScript, for programming and a component-based architecture for structuring the application.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This makes Angular difficult to change or adapt to specific needs.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your specific requirements and the experience of your development team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Here view the comparison of VueJS vs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/angularjs-vs-reactjs-suits-better\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">React vs Angular<\/a> in terms of features, developer adoption, performance, and overall value.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Ease of App Migration<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&#8217;re building a new app and aren&#8217;t already familiar with a framework, then we recommend starting with Vue. It is one of the easiest JS frameworks to learn compared to Angular &amp; React and can \u200cbuild simple apps immediately.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ease of App Migration is a major factor when deciding which framework to use. Sometimes, you may have an existing app \u200cyou&#8217;d like to migrate from AngularJS or Backbone.js. If so, Vue is likely your best bet as it has similar syntax and structure as these other frameworks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vue also uses components similar to React, making it easier for teams already familiar with React to transition over. This is not true for Angular, which uses directives instead of components.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>High Performance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose you need to choose one among Vue, React, and Angular in terms of performance. In that case, we&#8217;d recommend Vue over the other two as it is mostly a syntactical sugar on top of jQuery or Zepto (if you&#8217;re using jQuery or Zepto directly with Vue).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will help if you avoid cases where you need to use third-party libraries that may not be supported well by your framework. For example, if you want to integrate Bootstrap with your app, it&#8217;s best to use it with Vue, as Bootstrap is officially supported.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the case of frameworks like Angular and React, integrating third-party libraries will be more challenging as these are created for writing single-page applications that work independently. In some scenarios, such tools might not even support such integrations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><em><strong>Flexibility<\/strong><\/em><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A major selling point of Vue is that it offers an easier learning curve than React or Angular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest way to think about it is that Vue is (in theory) less opinionated than both other frameworks. Vue gives you more freedom regarding the structure of your application while still providing great functionality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In practice, less opinionated doesn&#8217;t mean not-opinionated at all\u2014but if you need a framework that lets you organize your application without being super strict about how everything fits together, Vue may be for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Coding Speed<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The basic idea behind Vue is &#8211; don\u2019t think about components and virtual DOM; just write code. That said, your app\u2019s performance will be limited by Vue (compared to both React and Angular). This shouldn\u2019t be an issue for applications under 10K lines of code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you have a larger application that uses third-party libraries like apollo-client, you might have to spend more time writing helper functions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, developers tend to use more JavaScript tools when using Vue than Angular or React because of its SPA foundation, which means it can be less approachable for beginners or those from an MVC background.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to build your own web app? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ValueCoders<\/a>, a leading <\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SOFTWARE OUTSOURCING COMPANY<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, has a talent pool of experienced <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/hire-developers\/hire-web-app-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">web app developers<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for startups and SMEs. <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/hire-developers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=angular_5030&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HIRE INDIAN APP PROGRAMMERS TODAY<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">!!<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Model<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vue has a single model object for all data. This helps keep things consistent and makes it easier to follow what is happening in your application. It also uses reactivity, which allows you to track changes made to data and ensure they reflect elsewhere in your application, using either one-way or two-way binding.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of that, Vue provides an easy way of doing simple computed properties (like array filtering). React provides no particular model implementation out of the box and leaves it up to developers to choose which pattern works best for them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Code Reusability<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All three frameworks are based on some form of virtual DOM diffing system. But \u200cVue\u2019s Reactivity system is more straightforward to reason about and use than that of Angular or React.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get more done with less code, which is always good. If there\u2019s one area where Vue excels, it\u2019s code reuse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mixin system makes it trivial to reuse entire templates without writing another line of HTML\u2014and you can even use these mixins without any additional configuration. Mixins are also a great tool for abstracting and simplifying complex behaviors in your application.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Community Support<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to any successful technology is a thriving community; when a programming language, library, or framework has been around for quite some time, its chances of succeeding become much higher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the opposite for any new technology that hits the market; to succeed, it must attract a dedicated community to support and expand. All three frameworks share similar communities; Vue is on par with its competitors regarding social media influence and conference attendance numbers.<\/span> <span style=\"font-size: 8px; color: #ffffff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.codersdaddy.com\/hire-developer-engineer-programmer\/dot-net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hire Dedicated .Net Developers in India<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><b>Know More: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/blog\/technology-and-apps\/angularjs-vs-reactjs-suits-better\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>ANGULARJS VS REACTJS<\/b><b>: WHAT\u2019S GOOD FOR YOUR BUSINESS?<\/b><\/a><\/span><\/h5>\n<hr \/>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Angular_vs_Vue_vs_React_Comparison_Table\"><\/span><b>Angular vs Vue vs React Comparison Table\u00a0<\/b><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is a table that would provide you with a few valuable pieces of information about Angular.js,\u00a0 Vue.js, and React.js frameworks.

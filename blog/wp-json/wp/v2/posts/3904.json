More than 82% of traffic online is video traffic (what\u2019s new in publishing). By getting some video content onto your site, you\u2019ll give yourself an edge when you want people to engage with your brand.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Video content in educational applications can include instructional videos, demonstrations, or tutorials that are embedded into a lesson plan. It\u2019s also crucial to note that video content isn\u2019t just for websites anymore\u200a\u2014\u200ait can also be used for mobile apps as well!<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Khan Academy proffers 1000+ free instructional videos for students to learn from at their own pace. These videos are available on both desktop and mobile devices, making it easy for students to learn on the go.<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">In a similar vein, Duolingo offers an app that is geared towards learning a new language through fun and engaging methods\u200a\u2014\u200aall while tracking your progress along the way!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This app is also available on both desktop and mobile devices, allowing you to seamlessly transition between platforms as you work towards mastering a new language.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">TeacherPayTeachers allows teachers to create and sell lesson plans online (in the form of video), which can be accessed by other teachers who are looking for supplemental material in their classrooms or homeschoolers.<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">\n<h3>MicroLearning<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"graf-image aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/0*cAb71L0_dD36A2g-\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"559\" data-image-id=\"0*cAb71L0_dD36A2g-\" data-width=\"1521\" data-height=\"1063\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\" style=\"padding-left: 240px; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Image Source: Raccoon Gang<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Gone are the days of 30-minute lectures on outdated topics.

The growing popularity of learning platforms like Edmodo and Pear Deck shows that many students (and teachers) love learning from peers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you\u2019re creating an educational app, include a way for users to interact with one another in some capacity\u200a\u2014\u200aideally, a platform that promotes collaborative sharing, feedback, and problem-solving.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Students will take great ownership over their own learning if they feel like they can collaborate with other users when solving problems or asking questions.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Think about how you can incorporate social functionality into your educational mobile app development process\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding discussions, commenting systems, and interactions like #hashtags.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Moreover, think about how you can make it easy for teachers to access student work and respond accordingly. With so much potential value being created by students, it\u2019s important to give them tools that help them showcase their work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">A teacher should be able to easily view all student submissions within an app at once and provide comments back on those submissions via simple thumbs up\/down buttons. This type of comment system provides quick peer review while still allowing teachers flexibility in providing feedback.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"graf graf--p\">Few famous education apps use collaborative leading as it is one of the majorly used Educational Mobile App trends:<\/h4>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Canvas allows educators to assign homework directly through their online interface, which is then automatically sent out as a push notification to each student\u2019s device.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Once students open up Canvas on their phones, they are presented with individual assignments along with comments from fellow classmates who may have already completed the assignment.<\/p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\">Google Classroom has a built-in discussion board where students can post questions for others to answer.

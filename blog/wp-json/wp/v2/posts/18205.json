You can extend it with anyone, or many, thousands of add-ons. Using modules, you can expand Drupal&#8217;s functionality, and customize the content presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles used as starter kits.

Here are those:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><\/b><b>Reliability<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. &#8211; An overall content management system with outstanding features. Now we have Drupal 8 and Drupal 9 to be released. But the previous versions will not turn obsolete at least in the next five years. It has resources that\u2019ll stay for longer.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Available resources<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Suppose you want to do with the system created and liked by people. Then Drupal is the choice. The fascinating thing is that many useful modules(Drupal add-ons) contribute more to the Drupal community. In other CMS, you pay for essential features.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Third-party Integration<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drupal gives the leverage to seamlessly operate seamless adjacent technologies. The API and external libraries make it interoperable with enterprise solutions such as <\/span><b>C<\/b><b><i>RM, Digital Asset Management, Web Analytics, &amp; multi-channel campaign management. <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can integrate with AI chatbots and an AI-driven recommendation engine to meet the needs of digital customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><b><\/b><b>Robust and convenient<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The source code for building Drupal sites is precisely written and designed by drupal experts. It gives the intention to execute complex and advanced work and find it easy convenient to modify. It provides you with a significant advantage over CMS.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Flexibility<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For proven reasons, Drupal leverages you with the most flexible CMS and gives a fair idea of how <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can create any content on site. You can customize anything that fits your taste.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Scalability<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By scalability, you can extend the Drupal core to a higher level with various contributed Drupal modules. The good thing about the Drupal module is that it integrates nicely with the Drupal core. It is the structure(NATURAL) of\u00a0 Drupal that makes it different from other CMS. Hence, allows the power of extending the Drupal website with a core strength of Drupal compared to other CMS. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Meanwhile, Drupal is open-source. So suppose the modules you need don\u2019t exist you can create one, edit an existing module, or hire someone to do the job.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Security: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security is the key in present times. Drupal is meticulously tested under strict security rules by Drupal experts and contributors as it has robust in-built security. It assimilates and protects whatever directory is installed, catering to essential data, the configuration of files not to be accessed directly. Big sites with extreme protection use Drupal, namely commerce.gov, weforums.org.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Latest_Drupal_9_Things_We_Need_to_Know\"><\/span><strong>The Latest Drupal 9: Things We Need to Know!<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we talk about Drupal 9, a 100% tested stable codebase of Drupal 8 minus deprecated code and provided additional features compared to the earlier version.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, you would like to know where to <\/span><b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.valuecoders.com\/hire-developers\/hire-drupal-developers?utm_source=website-18205-d7&amp;utm_medium=d7&amp;utm_campaign=website-18205-d7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hire drupal programmers<\/a> <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for having a great website experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are keeping things in mind the API-first development intention, with tools to define editorial work workflow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What is deprecated code, and why its removal needed?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A code gets deprecated when there&#8217;s an alternate to that.

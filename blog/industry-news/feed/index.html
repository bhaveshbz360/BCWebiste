<h2><strong>Let&#8217;s take an in-depth glimpse of these features.</strong></h2>
<h3><b>Block patterns</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress is presented with a new block pattern that allows you to create beautiful layouts simply with fun and use different kinds of text and media to mix &amp; match as per your need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, there is no dearth of block patterns of themes and plugins in this update, and you can select any of them from a single place. Basically, </span><a href="https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-16-7-7-release-wpblocktalk-block-patterns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gutenberg 7.7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and 7.8 introduced block patterns in March 2020 with APIs from plugins and themes. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-14670 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp4.jpg" alt="wordpress 5.5" width="891" height="478" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp4.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp4-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp4-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Img Src: themeum.com</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, these patterns are predefined layouts for creating blocks in design that allows users to include complex structures of nested blocks on their web pages. This feature helps site managers to reduce the blank page issues and create beautiful layouts and compelling views with ease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, they allow you to edit your web page in blocks which is another perk of this feature.</span></p>
<h3><b>New UI Design </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gutenberg plugins are the best when it comes to creating incredible web page design, as it brings small but valuable improvements that transform overall editing experience. Many of the changes will have been infused in the core of WordPress, so if you launch the block editor, you will experience a significant change that will drive your amusement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is what you will be found in this editor: simplified block toolbar, new icons, surrounding elements, stronger colour contrast, device previews, block movers, enhanced drag &amp; drop, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This block focuses on styling across complete UI, multiple block formatting at once, and better performance.  </span></p>
<p><b><i>If you want to craft an enticing and user-friendly UI within your application, you should </i></b><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-wordpress-developers?utm_source=blog_al&amp;utm_medium=wordpress5.5-14666&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><i>hire WordPress developers</i></a></strong><b><i><strong> t</strong>hat can leverage this feature to the fullest and table a unique UI experience.</i></b></p>
<h3><b>New Block Directory </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new block directory allows you to find, install and third party blocks from the block inserter, just via searching for a block on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plugin directory prompts you to a list of plugins, that allows you to pick &#8220;block plugins&#8221; and insert them to your editor simply. Altogether, it allows you to get a third-party block from the WordPress community, which is an awesome feature to use in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only this, but you can craft your own blocks and publish them into your own directory, which makes it a valuable web <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/10-top-web-development-frameworks-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>development framework. </strong></a></span></p>
<h3><b>Inline Image Editing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image editing is a major issue that developers face while creating any web page. While the image is the major part of each web page. This new editing feature allows you to use a new block editor with Gutenberg 8.4, which enables you to edit images directly within the block. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means now WordPress 5.5 will allow you to crop, adjust, rotate, zoom image position within the media library and provide you with a faster editing experience.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-14671 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp5.jpg" alt="wordpress 5.5" width="1007" height="538" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp5.jpg 1272w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp5-300x160.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp5-1024x547.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp5-768x411.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Img Src: themeum.com</span></strong></p>
<h3><b>Block Category &amp; Revamped Block Inserter Panel </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The block inserter is another incredible service in WordPress 5.5 that allows you to view blocks and patterns on the basis of categories, significant improvements, editing experience, and easy block pattern search. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature provides developers with incredible assistance that allows you to insert blocks simply without any inconvenience. Altogether, you don&#8217;t need to be a PHP expert for creating custom blocks, just a bit knowledge of JavaScript would do the magic for you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are unaware of how to create a bloc, you can get in touch with a WordPress community available to hold your hand every time in tough times.</span></p>
<h3><b>Feature For Image Lazy Loading</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another cherishing feature that is being admired by a number of WordPress users is &#8220;lazy loading&#8221;. Its name includes enough curiosity for the features, while it allows image loading on for visible images to the users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means the images visible to the user will load faster, and other image loadings will be delayed. WordPress 5.5 is setting it as default for sites by catering the &#8220;loading&#8221; attribute to the IMG tag.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-14672 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp6.jpg" alt="wordpress 5.5" width="1047" height="463" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp6.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp6-300x133.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp6-768x340.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1047px) 100vw, 1047px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Img Src: wphive.com</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, almost every modern browser is supporting this feature. It helps in enhancing the website&#8217;s speed &amp; performance. Altogether, it is also a significant perk for WordPress hosting companies and interwebs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Note:</strong> This feature doesn&#8217;t work on safari only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, WordPress is boosting 35% of websites over the web, and this feature will enhance the speed for sites while improving bandwidth, electricity, and server resources.</span></p>
<h3>NEW DEFAULT XML SITEMAPS IN WORDPRESS</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If publishing a site map is your biggest pain, then it is good news for you. Now WordPress will publish your website sitemap automatically, as WordPress 5.5 is keeping the facility &#8220;default&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a very critical feature to ensure the best SEO practice. It will be great ease for beginners unaware of site map creation. Though, WordPress XML sitemaps have a few features and functionalities to follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why WordPress is using the capabilities of two powerful SEO plugins: </span><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><b>SEO Pack</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><b>Yoast SEO</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will provide their own XML sitemaps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are already leveraging an SEO plugin or sitemap, you don&#8217;t need to worry as they will automatically go disabled and WordPress 5.5 XML sitemap will set as &#8220;default&#8221; .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, these are newly arrived features in WordPress 5.5 web development framework. I am sure you will be delighted to see these changes, as they make web design &amp; development super easy and user friendly. Hire a </span><b><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/web-application-development?utm_source=blog_al&amp;utm_medium=wordpress5.5-14666&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">web development company</a> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">that can help you leverage WordPress potential in your next project.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Let&#8217;s understand more about WordPress 5.5 performance and efficiency that makes it a great framework for web development. </i></b></p>
<h2><b>How Is WordPress 5.5 Better Than Other Versions?</b></h2>
<h2><b>Better Loading Speed</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development&#8217;s most critical aspect is page loading speed. At the same time, a huge number of elements and images makes it slow. But this version of WordPress takes page loading to another label by infusing features like lazy load, block features for efficiency, and custom block creation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using this version of WordPress, your web page will load faster than any other version. Altogether, the issue of the image loading time is resolved by this application program.</span></p>
<h2><b>Accessibility</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each WordPress release brings in some enhancement when it comes to the publishing experience. This release of WordPress integrates higher accessibility for publishing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows you to copy links in media screens and modal dialogues using a button; you don&#8217;t need to highlight any text or line for showing links. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including this framework allows you to move meta boxes using the keyboard and image editing with an assistive device.</span></p>
<h2><b>Security</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another main aspect of each application is improved data security, especially when it comes to installing plugins. Codes can be a bit messy and go complex at times that cause heavy applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic plugin updates feature infuse incredible security that makes this web development framework incredibly easy.</span></p>
<h2><b>Major Issues Encountered In WordPress 5.5</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After the release of WordPress 5.5, several bugs and issues have been encountered by the developers. Here I am enlisting major issues that will soon be resolved by the WordPress team. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>SiteMap Bug:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this new version has a pagination error which is preventing page sitemap redirection and giving unexpected behaviour. </span></li>
<li><b>JavaScript Error: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of older plugins and themes are causing errors that are preventing the publishing of articles and images. This bug can be fixed by the programmer by making changes in the source code.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, the issues are annoying too many new WordPress users. However, the company will fix these errors soon in the coming days.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oracle has recently delivered the new Java 10 within the previously announced deadline. It is a feature release of the Java SE platform which got released on March 20, 2018. It contains various new features and enhancements in many functional areas. Some of its key improvements include enhancements for garbage collection and compilation as well as local variable types.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georges Saab, vice president of Software Development in Oracle&#8217;s Java Platform Group, said that &#8220;Oracle is committed to rapidly evolving and delivering new innovations in the Java platform – this being the first in our newly adopted release cycle and licensing model. We&#8217;re especially proud of the simplicity of this release, which introduces useful new features, removes unnecessary elements, and Java 10 is easy for developers to use.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java 10 is scheduled to be a short-term release and its public updates are slated to end in six months. Moreover, the JDK 11 will be the long-term support (LTS) version of Java which is due in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can download Java 10 by </span><strong><a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">clicking here.</a></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Java 10 features</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Java features are defined through the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JDK Enhancement Proposals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (JEP) process and are mentioned below:</span></p>
<h3>Application Data-Class Sharing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Java 10, JEP means the existing Class-Data Sharing (&#8220;CDS&#8221;) a feature for allowing application classes to be placed in the shared archive in order to improve startup and footprint.</span></p>
<h3>Parallel Full GC for G1</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java 10 improves G1 worst-case latencies by making the full GC parallel.</span></p>
<h3>Garbage Collector Interface</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will improve the source code isolation of different garbage collectors by introducing a clean garbage collector (GC) interface.</span></p>
<h3>Consolidate the JDK Forest into a Single Repository</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will combine the numerous repositories of the JDK forest into a single repository to simplify and streamline development.</span></p>
<h3>Local-Variable Type Inference</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java 10 will enhance the Java Language to extend type inference to declarations of local variables with initializers and also introduces var to Java, something that is common in other languages.</span></p>
<h3>Remove the Native-Header Generator Tool</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will remove the java tool from the JDK since it has been superseded by superior functionality in javac.</span></p>
<h3>Thread-Local Handshakes</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It introduces a way to execute a callback on threads without performing a global VM safepoint. This makes it both possible and cheap to stop individual threads and not just all threads or none.</span></p>
<h3>Time-Based Release Versioning</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java 10 revises the version-string scheme of the Java SE Platform and the JDK, and related versioning information, for present and future time-based release models.</span></p>
<h3>Root Certificates</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides a default set of root Certification Authority (CA) certificates in the JDK.</span></p>
<h3>Heap Allocation on Alternative Memory Devices</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It enables the HotSpot VM to allocate the Java object heap on an alternative memory device, such as an NV-DIMM, specified by the user.</span></p>
<h3>Experimental Java-Based JIT Compiler</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It enables the Java-based JIT compiler, Graal, to be used as an experimental JIT compiler on the Linux/x64 platform.</span></p>
<h3>Additional Unicode Language-Tag Extensions</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Java 10 will enhance the <em>java.util.Locale</em> and related APIs to implement additional Unicode extensions of BCP 47 language tags.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Removed Features and Options in Java 10</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will describe the Java 10 APIs, features, and options that were removed in Java SE 10 and JDK 10. It may also identify potential compatibility issues that you could encounter when migrating to JDK 10.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Deprecated Features and Options in Java 10</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will describe the deprecated Java 10 features, APIs, and options that have been identified as deprecated in this release and are subject to removal from future versions of Java SE and the JDK. They should be used with that possibility in mind.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Final thoughts on JAVA 10</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So overall, it seems that this release is not exactly a cause for alarm as it doesn&#8217;t contain any major changes that may require adaptation. However, it represents the first release in the new, more frequent and gradual release cycle. It’s impressive enough that Java 10 was delivered as-promised and Just-in-Time like its compiler. The coming time will tell &#8220;Will Java community accept the new delivered model&#8221;. For developers, the new Java is much more useful than its previous versions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google has released the first beta SDK of Flutter, a mobile UI framework, that helps developers in creating interfaces for the apps on Android as well as the iOS platform. This toolkit can speed up and enhance cross-platform app development. This beta release builds amazing native apps for businesses and is also a powering experimental Fuchsia OS.</p>
<p>Flutter Beta release, announced at Mobile World Congress 2018 in Barcelona, brings a more refined version of the SDK(Software development kit) to developers as compared to its alpha release which got released last year. The toolkit acts as a layer of middleware, allowing the developers to create code that can be run on a variety of different operating systems, extending the application&#8217;s reach to multiple platforms. It has claimed to offer its developers a source to build high-quality native interfaces for both iOS and Android.</p>
<p>However, Flutter is being used in various major projects of Google. In fact, Fuchsia OS is built on Flutter and apps like AdWords are using the open source framework to prove its success. With its new release, it has become a handy UI solution for developers in order to build cross-platform apps. This beta release works well with a pre-release version of Dart 2 language and also includes support for declaring UI within the code along with minimal language ceremony.</p>
<h3>It has come up with the following features:<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8245" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ui.jpg" alt="" width="1152" height="671" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ui.jpg 1720w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ui-600x350.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ui-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ui-768x447.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ui-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ui-960x559.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /></h3>
<p>&#8211; Platform interop which will expose the power of mobile platforms to Flutter code<br />
&#8211; New refactoring feature to help developers in managing their widget code.<br />
&#8211; Improved stateful hot reloads<br />
&#8211; New widget inspector which provides an easy view to browse the entire widget tree.</p>
<hr />
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Related Blog: <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/is-google-fuchsia-the-new-android/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">Is Google Fuchsia, the new Android?</a></strong></span></h5>
<hr />
<h3>Google has also highlighted the three major benefits of using Flutter for your mobile app development. These are mentioned below:</h3>
<p><strong>1) Expressive and flexible designs</strong> with composible widget sets, rich animation libraries, and a layered, extensible architecture.</p>
<p><strong>2) High-velocity development</strong> which provides new features, rich widget set, reactive framework and integrated tooling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8243" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/high-velcity.gif" alt="" width="878" height="522" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Image Source: <a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Flutter</a></p>
<p><strong>3) High-quality experiences</strong> cross devices and platform with built-in GPU-accelerated renderer and native ARM code runtime and platform interop.</p>
<p>So, developers now don&#8217;t have to stick only to Android development as Flutter offers a unified solution for apps supporting multiple platforms. It also has the ability to transform the experience from one platform to another by changing the behaviour of the scroll, buttons, sliders, dialog boxes and switches, among others, from the Android Material Design standards to the Cupertino iOS.</p>
<p>Moreover, Google is expected to detail the new features of Flutter in its I/O 2018 later this year. The same I/O location could be used to reveal certain information about the Fuchsia operating system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Reality is no longer a future technology now as it is already expanding and on the verge of exploding, especially, due to increasing demand for VR mobile apps and services from enterprises. This is a never-ending trend and the <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers?" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">mobile app developers</a></strong> should capitalize upon this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many VR companies are developing the products like VR headsets and other VR devices to help people in turning their mobile devices into VR gadgets. This is really a good step in the exposure of VR technology to the maximum number of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VR is continuously changing the way people do communicate, shop and business via mobile apps. In fact, a large number of enterprises in the business landscape are benefiting from it including manufacturing, aerospace, medicine, real estate, fashion, and entertainment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With VR mobile apps, users can actually see the virtual perceptions of various products, services and places in real. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, VR-enabled devices from various big companies like Samsung, Google, Facebook, Sony have greatly succeeded in making VR a mainstream technology. That&#8217;s why mobile app development companies are developing innovative VR mobile apps today which are further enhanced by the capabilities of these latest smart devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, UI design plays an important role while developing VR mobile apps. It is quite different from the UI of standard mobile applications. In fact, some additional support devices may be needed to perform some in-app movements. As part of the implementation of the user interface design, the user may have to hold the device in hand to track gestures or use headphones to track the head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog, we have listed out the important features of <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">VR mobile app development</a></strong> and some of the major VR apps used today.</span></p>
<p><b>Check out the list of benefits below that VR mobile apps provide:</b></p>
<h3><b>1) Smooth op<span style="color: #333333;">erations of VRR mobile apps</span></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VR app development is chosen if you want to develop mobile apps for VR devices. And, ensuring smooth operations is key to successful VR app development. No user wants to experience animation lagging and cropping if your VR app fails to run at 60 fps. To curb this problem, <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-software-developers-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software app developers</a></strong> should try to avoid persistent bugs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than focussing on creating super effects, they preference should be according to the development of smooth app operation. This is concerned with the way how scenes are arranged on the screen by them. This establishes a great picture with a stable performance and thus provides smooth app operation. </span></p>
<h3><b>2) Enhanced learning experience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VR apps give developers more interactive learning experiences. Thus, it creates a viable opportunity for growth in the mobile app development. In fact, many app development companies are making use of these VR apps in order to create an enjoyable learning environment for their developers. </span></p>
<h3><b>3) Stable and efficient tracking</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual reality mobile apps are designed to track the positions of the heads and change the images on the screens of smartphones. There are several sensors that the application can use to obtain relevant information about the position of a smartphone, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These apps are capable of calculating general-position vectors based on the data. Thus, virtual reality applications can easily adjust the image that is displayed to help users see exactly what they want to see.</span></p>
<h3><b>4) Boosts business productivity</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VR mobile apps are good for businesses today. It makes business conferences and meetings more productive. Moreover, they are also working to transform the way they organize teleconferences, which ultimately results in considerable savings on business travel.</span></p>
<h3><b>5) Amazing experience on the go</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, developing VR-enabled applications can provide people with an incredible customer experience, no matter where they are located. Application developers are creating virtual reality applications for industries such as tourism, hotels, real estate and e-commerce to allow users to enjoy an enhanced virtual experience of the product or service they are buying.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google has launched Google Play Security Reward Program just a few days back in coordination with bug bounty platform HackerOne. However, Google itself runs its own bug bounties for Android, Chrome, and websites and now expanding this concept to popular Android Apps. For this, researchers will be paid $1,000 reward for qualifying vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>As per HackerOne, hackers will identify the app vulnerabilities and report it to the developers as soon as they find them. After this, the hacker will request for a reward from the program. Once it is evaluated to check whether it meets the Google’s criteria or not, he will be awarded $1000 for this.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29562 size-full" title="android 199225 1280" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/android-199225_1280.jpg" alt="Android Security" width="1280" height="800" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/android-199225_1280.jpg 1280w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/android-199225_1280-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/android-199225_1280-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/android-199225_1280-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Note: Google brings the bug bounty vulnerability research model to Android apps in the Play Store.</p>
<p>Google Play Security Reward Program includes following apps till now:</p>
<p>&#8211; Dropbox, Alibaba, Duolingo, Line, Mail.Ru, Headspace, Tinder, Snapchat</p>
<h3><b>How does it work?</b></h3>
<p>To know its working, one should be aware of &#8220;qualifying bugs&#8221; for which researchers are awarded. These bugs are limited to RCE(remote code execution) flaws that work on Android devices with version 4.4 or above. This includes attacks which allow malicious code to be downloaded and executed, opening a webview in an app for phishing and manipulating the user interface to cause a fraudulent transaction. Here is its working:</p>
<p>&#8211; Researchers find bugs and report it directly to the app’s developer via their current vulnerability disclosure process.</p>
<p>&#8211; The bounty page consists of links to the page where they report issues to the participating firms.</p>
<p>&#8211; App developer fixes the bug while working with them.</p>
<p>&#8211; Once the bug gets resolved, the researchers request a reward from the Google Play Security Reward Program.</p>
<p>&#8211; Android Security team issues an additional reward to thank them for improving security within the Google Play ecosystem.</p>
<p>Many companies in the bounty program are already offering bug bounties separately via HackerOne or through their own programs. Some of these companies are listed below:</p>
<p>&#8211; Tinder has bug bounty which is a private program.</p>
<p>&#8211; Dropbox is running its bounty since 2014 and currently offers $15,625 for &#8220;trivial&#8221; RCE&#8217;s affecting its Android app, iOS and higher rewards for attacks on its servers.</p>
<p>&#8211; Snapchat has already paid out approx. $140,000 via HackerOne bounty program.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Now it&#8217;s official. The complete new Angularjs version is now officially available. 6 years back in 2010, Google first launched Angularjs, a new way to develop web applications. Then in 2014 22-23 Sept Google announced that a new Angularjs version is going to be released with a complete rewrite.  Now, after the final Angularjs 2 release, this is what they have to say:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #800000;">&#8220;<em>Angular 1 first solved the problem of how to develop for an emerging web. Six years later, the challenges faced by today’s application developers, and the sophistication of the devices that applications must support, have both changed immensely. With this release, and its more capable versions of the Router, Forms, and other core APIs, today you can build amazing apps for any platform. If you prefer your own approach, Angular is also modular and flexible, so you can use your favorite third-party library or write your own.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<h2><strong>Find more about AngularJS 2 here:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This clearly says that this Angularjs version is much improved and contains many advanced features. Watch this video of the press conference that was held on 14th Sept this year expressing the excitement of the Angular 2 release:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Why Angularjs 2 over Angularjs 1?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now the obvious question is why would you switch to Angularjs 2 from Angularjs 1?  Right now 1.3 million developers use Angularjs 1 and 480K developers already use Angularjs 2. Here are the reasons why Angularjs 2 is better than the previous Angular version. You can also <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-angularjs-developers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=Angularjs-4769&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire Angularjs developers</a> to solve all kinds of technical issues.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Template basics</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Templates are user-facing part of an Angularjs 2 app and are written in HTML.  They made some major changes in the basic templates as well. This includes Bindings, Filters and local variables.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Template directives</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Angularjs 1 offers more than 70 build-in directives for templates. In AngularJS 2, many of them are not necessary. They have created some equivalents in this new Angularjs version.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Related : <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/advantages-of-angular-js-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Top 10 advantages of Angularjs</a></strong></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Filters/pipes</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Angularjs 2 pipes offer formatting and transformation for data in the template, like Angular 1 filters. Hence, there are many built-in filters in Angular 1 have corresponding pipes in Angularjs 2.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Modules/controllers/components</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In both Angular 1 &amp; 2, Angular modules help to organize your application into cohesive blocks of functionality. In the previous Angularjs version, you write the code that provides the model and the methods for the view in a controller. In Angularjs 2, you build a component. Because much Angular 1 code is in JavaScript, JavaScript code is shown in the Angular 1 column. The Angularjs 2 code is shown using TypeScript.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Style sheets</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Style sheets give your app a nice look. In Angularjs 1, you specify the style sheets for your entire app. As the app grows over time, the styles for the many parts of the same merge, which causes unexpected results sometimes. In Angular 2, you can still define style sheets for your entire app. However, now you can also encapsulate a style sheet within a specific component.</p>

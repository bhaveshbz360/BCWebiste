<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the core of personalization is the creation of detailed user profiles. Netflix NLP recommendations analyze a user&#8217;s viewing history, interactions, and textual feedback to build a comprehensive understanding of their unique interests and tastes. NLP is crucial in extracting meaningful information from this data, enabling the creation of rich user profiles that capture even the subtlest of preferences.</span></p>
<h3><b>Matching Users to Content</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a deep understanding of both its users and content library, Netflix employs sophisticated algorithms to match users with relevant and engaging recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process involves a combination of techniques:</span></p>
<p><b>Collaborative Filtering:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> By analyzing the viewing patterns and preferences of users with similar tastes, Netflix can recommend content that others with comparable interests have enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><b>Content-Based Filtering:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Netflix uses the detailed content analysis facilitated by NLP to recommend shows and movies that align with a user&#8217;s preferences for specific genres, themes, actors, or directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The integration of NLP-enhanced user profiles and content analysis significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of these Netflix recommendation algorithms. This ensures that users are offered tailored suggestions that resonate with their personal interests.</span></p>
<h3><b>Example Scenarios</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a user who has shown a preference for historical dramas and has positively reviewed shows featuring strong female leads. The Netflix NLP recommendations system would not only identify these preferences but also understand the contextual nuances behind them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the user might receive recommendations for a new period drama series with a compelling female protagonist, even if it deviates from their typical viewing patterns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, if a user consistently watches and enjoys foreign-language films, the Netflix NLP recommendations engine will use Natural Language Processing to understand the subtleties of these preferences, suggesting similar content that may not be explicitly labeled as &#8220;foreign-language&#8221; but shares the same cultural and linguistic richness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix’s personalized recommendations aim to minimize the time users spend searching for their next great viewing experience, ensuring they can seamlessly discover content that aligns with their unique tastes and preferences. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the development of Meta LLaMA 3 model, a commitment to innovation, scalability, and simplicity was paramount. This guiding principle influenced every aspect of the project, with a particular emphasis on four essential elements: the model&#8217;s architecture, the data used for pretraining, the process of scaling up pretraining and fine-tuning through instruction.</span></p>
<h3><b>Optimized Model Architecture</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why LLaMA matters? Following their design philosophy, the team behind LLaMA 3 chose a standard decoder-only transformer architecture. Compared to its predecessor, LLaMA 2, several key enhancements were implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LLaMA 3 features a tokenizer with a vocabulary of 128K tokens, improving language encoding efficiency and consequently enhancing model performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, to boost the inference efficiency of Meta LLaMA 3 models, grouped query attention (GQA) was adopted across both the 8B and 70B sizes. These models were trained on sequences of 8,192 tokens, with a masking mechanism ensuring that self-attention does not extend beyond document boundaries.</span></p>
<h3><b>Extensive High-Quality Training Data</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring the best language model requires a meticulously curated, extensive training dataset. Adhering to their design principles, the team behind LLaMA 3 prioritized investing in pretraining data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LLaMA 3 underwent pretraining on a dataset containing over 15 trillion tokens sourced entirely from publicly accessible platforms. This dataset is notably seven times larger than that utilized for LLaMA 2, with a fourfold increase in code content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In anticipation of future multilingual applications, more than 5% of LLaMA 3&#8217;s pretraining dataset comprises high-quality non-English data spanning over 30 languages. However, it&#8217;s acknowledged that performance in these languages may not reach the same level as in English.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To guarantee that LLaMA 3 is trained on top-notch data, a set of data-filtering pipelines was devised. These pipelines incorporate heuristic filters, NSFW filters, semantic deduplication methods, and text classifiers to assess data quality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, earlier versions of LLaMA demonstrated proficiency in identifying high-quality data. As a result, LLaMA 2 was utilized to generate training data for the text-quality classifiers powering LLaMA 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensive experiments were conducted to determine the most effective methods of combining data from various sources in the ultimate pretraining dataset. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These experiments helped identify a data blend that guarantees optimal performance for the Meta LLaMA 3 model across various applications, including trivia questions, STEM topics, coding, historical knowledge, and more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generative AI models have become more popular lately, but their beginnings go way back to the early days of AI research in the 1950s and 1960s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of generative models has been around since then, showing that this technology has been in the works for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One important early step in this area was creating models called Markov chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These models were designed to figure out the chances of different sequences of data happening. They helped set the stage for working with and making sequences of data like text and speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 1980s and 1990s, researchers started looking into more advanced generative models. These included things like Bayesian networks and Gaussian mixture models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These models could handle more complicated types of data, helping to improve how we understand and create data patterns. This led to progress in machine learning and figuring out probabilities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of deep learning in the late 2000s completely changed how Generative AI works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Methods like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) allowed deep neural networks to be trained to make very realistic and varied data in areas like images, text, and sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ai/generative-ai-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Generative AI development company</a></strong> is getting better and better due to improvements in deep learning, computer power, and having big sets of data to learn from. </span></p>

<h2><b>How Does Generative AI Work?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand how Generative AI works, you need to know about machine learning and probabilistic modeling. </span></p>
<p><b>Essentially, Generative AI models use smart algorithms to create new data by recognizing patterns in existing data.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a simple explanation of how Generative AI works:</span><b></b></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-40566" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/How-Does-Generative-AI-Work_-998x1024.jpg" alt="How Does Generative AI Work" width="640" height="657" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/How-Does-Generative-AI-Work_-998x1024.jpg 998w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/How-Does-Generative-AI-Work_-292x300.jpg 292w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/How-Does-Generative-AI-Work_-768x788.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/How-Does-Generative-AI-Work_-451x463.jpg 451w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/How-Does-Generative-AI-Work_.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>1. Training Data</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generative AI algorithms need a lot of data to learn properly. This data helps the AI figure out what patterns and features to include in its generated outputs. For instance, if it&#8217;s supposed to make pictures of cats, the training data would include many pictures of cats from different angles, types, and backgrounds.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>2. Learning Patterns</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While training, the AI looks at the data to find patterns, features, and connections that show up often. It learns things like shapes, colors, textures, and styles that are common in the data. This part of the process uses lots of math and special techniques to tweak the AI&#8217;s settings and ensure its ability to spot these patterns.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>3. Generating New Data</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After it&#8217;s been trained, the Generative AI model puts what it&#8217;s learned into action by making new data samples. For instance, if it&#8217;s learned from pictures of cats, it can make new pictures that look similar. It does this by using what it knows about the chances of different things happening and mixing them together in new ways. The generated data may exhibit variations and nuances inspired by the original dataset but can also introduce novel interpretations or variations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>4. Fine-Tuning</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on what it&#8217;s being used for, the new data might need some polishing. Fine-tuning methods can be used to make the new stuff better, more varied, or more fitting for what&#8217;s needed. This might mean changing settings, touching things up after they&#8217;re made, or adding extra rules to make sure the new data matches what&#8217;s wanted.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>5. Evaluation</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making new data, it&#8217;s important to check if it&#8217;s good enough, real enough, and fits the job it&#8217;s meant for. Different things might be looked at depending on what it&#8217;s being used for, like how real it looks, how varied it is, if it makes sense, or if it&#8217;s useful. This feedback helps understand how well the Generative AI is working and can guide making it better in the future.</span><b></b></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">6. Iterative Improvement</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generative AI models are often refined and improved iteratively over time. This means they&#8217;re constantly being trained on new and improved sets of data, adjusting settings as needed, and listening to feedback on how they perform. The goal is to make them work even better, be stronger, and do more things to meet the changing demands of real-life situations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By doing all these things, <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ai/generative-ai-integration-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Generative AI integration services</a></strong> algorithms can make lots of different and imaginative things in areas like art, design, and entertainment.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Meta AI chatbot has been tested with a few users since November 2023. Now, it&#8217;s being rolled out to more people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson from Meta said, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are currently developing generative AI-powered experiences at different stages, and we are testing several of them with the public in a limited way.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the testing phase for private WhatsApp users in India and South Africa, two key new functions enabled by WhatsApp AI are:</span><b></b></p>

<h2><b>Benefits of Meta WhatsApp AI</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What advantages does WhatsApp AI Meta offer users?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few more reasons why the introduction of AI in WhatsApp is beneficial:</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40329" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-WhatsApp-AI.jpg" alt="Meta WhatsApp AI" width="1004" height="499" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-WhatsApp-AI.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-WhatsApp-AI-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-WhatsApp-AI-768x382.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-WhatsApp-AI-480x239.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px" /></p>

<h3><b>How to create an AI image in WhatsApp</b></h3>
<p>One of the most thrilling additions is the AI-driven image creation in WhatsApp. <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-ai-engineers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Hire AI engineers</a></strong> to add this feature.

<h2><b>The Buzz on WhatsApp AI</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhatsApp AI has received acclaim from various publications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per The Indian Express: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The incorporation of AI into WhatsApp is revolutionary, providing users with a mix of convenience and innovation that improves the overall user experience.&#8221;</span></i><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40335" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Buzz-on-WhatsApp-AI0A.png" alt="Buzz on WhatsApp AI" width="993" height="219" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Buzz-on-WhatsApp-AI0A.png 1002w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Buzz-on-WhatsApp-AI0A-300x66.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Buzz-on-WhatsApp-AI0A-768x169.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Buzz-on-WhatsApp-AI0A-480x106.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 993px) 100vw, 993px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publications in South Africa, such as MyBroadband, highlighted WhatsApp&#8217;s privacy concerns in their coverage of the news.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40340" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/whatsapp-metas-AI.png" alt="whatsapp meta's AI" width="729" height="435" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/whatsapp-metas-AI.png 1278w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/whatsapp-metas-AI-300x179.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/whatsapp-metas-AI-1024x611.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/whatsapp-metas-AI-768x458.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/whatsapp-metas-AI-480x286.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechRadar&#8217;s U.S. edition also covered the news.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40336" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Chatbot-experiment.png" alt="AI Chatbot experiment" width="809" height="741" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Chatbot-experiment.png 649w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Chatbot-experiment-300x275.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Chatbot-experiment-480x440.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we believe that the renowned tech publication, TechCrunch, was one of the earliest to report on WhatsApp AI news. They stated: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Meta has confirmed to TechCrunch that it is testing Meta AI, its large language model-powered chatbot, with WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger users in India and parts of Africa. The move indicates Meta&#8217;s strategy to leverage large user bases across its various apps to expand its AI capabilities.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-40337 aligncenter" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-trials.png" alt="Meta trials" width="826" height="727" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-trials.png 806w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-trials-300x264.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-trials-768x676.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-trials-480x422.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" /></p>
<h2><b>A Note on WhatsApp AI Privacy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, when AI is in play, there have been concerns about the privacy of users&#8217; messages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhatsApp is a company that takes these concerns seriously and is known for its efforts to ensure messages are end-to-end encrypted and prioritize data privacy within the app. You can find WhatsApp&#8217;s complete privacy policy here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhatsApp&#8217;s FAQ page states that the new AI tools are designed with privacy in focus, guaranteeing that all interactions are encrypted and secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This dedication to user privacy is essential, particularly when incorporating advanced technologies such as AI into widely utilized applications.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The most important thing to know is that your messages with friends and family are off-limits. AIs can read what is sent to them, but your messages remain end-to-end encrypted, so no one else, including Meta, can see them.”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; </span><a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/1002544104126998" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhatsApp</span></a></p>

<h2><b>Meta LLaMA Powers WhatsApp AI</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does WhatsApp incorporate AI into its app? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is achievable through Meta&#8217;s LLaMA (Language Model Meta AI) tool.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40331" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-LLaMA-Powers-WhatsApp-AI.jpg" alt="Meta LLaMA Powers WhatsApp AI" width="984" height="500" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-LLaMA-Powers-WhatsApp-AI.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-LLaMA-Powers-WhatsApp-AI-300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-LLaMA-Powers-WhatsApp-AI-768x390.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Meta-LLaMA-Powers-WhatsApp-AI-480x244.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" /></p>

<h2><b>How To Build Large Language Models for Enterprises?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Large language models for enterprises can be extremely time-consuming and resource-exhaustive task. Hence, most enterprises are likely to opt for customizing existing models to their needs.</span></p>
<p><b>Customizing existing base models (also called pre-trained models or PLMs) can be typically split into 3 essential steps:</b></p>
<p><b>1. Finding a well-suited foundation model (PLM)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: This requires considering the ideal model size, training tasks and datasets, LLM providers, and more.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Fine-tuning the model: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Base models can be fine-tuned on a specific corpus and for a specific use case. </span></p>
<p><b>3. Optimizing the model: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the model is updated based on positive or negative human feedback on its predictions or classifications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, enterprises may choose to only customize base models using parameter-efficient techniques like adapters and p-tuning. Customization yields especially accurate models when the base model is trained on tasks similar to the selected downstream tasks. </span></p>

As per </span><a href="https://www.pwc.com/ug/en/press-room/turn-your-organizations-attention-to-ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><b>PwC</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>nearly 72% of hospitality leaders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plan to implement AI-powered revenue management solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ability to analyze mountains of data, AI enables hotels and travel businesses to set optimal, market-aligned prices dynamically. This helps them maximize occupancy and revenue while delivering value to customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI pricing tools in the hospitality industry automatically adjust rates accurately based on market demand, events, and competitor prices. As AI transforms hospitality, players embracing dynamic pricing require intelligent, integrated solutions that can drive perceivable ROI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog post explores best practices in leveraging AI for pricing in hospitality, its implementation considerations, use cases demonstrating the competitive advantage unlocked by AI, and a glimpse into the future of this revolutionary technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s dive in!</span></p>
<h2><strong>Understanding Dynamic Pricing in Hospitality</strong></h2>
<p><b>Dynamic pricing, or real-time pricing, refers to a pricing strategy where hotel businesses and online travel aggregators automatically adjust room rates in response to market demand shifts.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This helps maximize both occupancy and revenue per available room.</span></p>

</ol>
<h3><strong>2. Strategic Data Infrastructure</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Consolidated datasets:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Organized, high-quality historical and live data beyond core PMS data like bookings, cancellations, stay patterns, guest demographics, comp sets, and competitor pricing data is imperative to train and operate pricing models.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Automated data pipelining:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Smart connectivity via APIs automatically transfers relevant datasets from hotel systems into cloud data lakes, avoiding manual efforts. This enables accessible data for model retraining.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Continuous feedback loops:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dynamic rates management solutions algorithms update pricing models by continually ingesting the latest hotel demand signals, booking conversions, and competitor price changes. This tight refinement loop drives recommendation accuracy.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>3. Operational Integration</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Partial automation with overrides:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Blending AI-based dynamic pricing automation with human oversight capabilities allows manual overrides during exceptions like emergencies while benefiting from automation.</span></li>

This ensures that users are offered tailored suggestions that resonate with their personal interests.</span></p>
<h3><b>Example Scenarios</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a user who has shown a preference for historical dramas and has positively reviewed shows featuring strong female leads. The Netflix NLP recommendations system would not only identify these preferences but also understand the contextual nuances behind them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the user might receive recommendations for a new period drama series with a compelling female protagonist, even if it deviates from their typical viewing patterns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, if a user consistently watches and enjoys foreign-language films, the Netflix NLP recommendations engine will use Natural Language Processing to understand the subtleties of these preferences, suggesting similar content that may not be explicitly labeled as &#8220;foreign-language&#8221; but shares the same cultural and linguistic richness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix’s personalized recommendations aim to minimize the time users spend searching for their next great viewing experience, ensuring they can seamlessly discover content that aligns with their unique tastes and preferences. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the development of Meta LLaMA 3 model, a commitment to innovation, scalability, and simplicity was paramount. This guiding principle influenced every aspect of the project, with a particular emphasis on four essential elements: the model&#8217;s architecture, the data used for pretraining, the process of scaling up pretraining and fine-tuning through instruction.</span></p>
<h3><b>Optimized Model Architecture</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why LLaMA matters? Following their design philosophy, the team behind LLaMA 3 chose a standard decoder-only transformer architecture. Compared to its predecessor, LLaMA 2, several key enhancements were implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LLaMA 3 features a tokenizer with a vocabulary of 128K tokens, improving language encoding efficiency and consequently enhancing model performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, to boost the inference efficiency of Meta LLaMA 3 models, grouped query attention (GQA) was adopted across both the 8B and 70B sizes. These models were trained on sequences of 8,192 tokens, with a masking mechanism ensuring that self-attention does not extend beyond document boundaries.</span></p>
<h3><b>Extensive High-Quality Training Data</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring the best language model requires a meticulously curated, extensive training dataset. Adhering to their design principles, the team behind LLaMA 3 prioritized investing in pretraining data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LLaMA 3 underwent pretraining on a dataset containing over 15 trillion tokens sourced entirely from publicly accessible platforms. This dataset is notably seven times larger than that utilized for LLaMA 2, with a fourfold increase in code content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In anticipation of future multilingual applications, more than 5% of LLaMA 3&#8217;s pretraining dataset comprises high-quality non-English data spanning over 30 languages. However, it&#8217;s acknowledged that performance in these languages may not reach the same level as in English.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To guarantee that LLaMA 3 is trained on top-notch data, a set of data-filtering pipelines was devised. These pipelines incorporate heuristic filters, NSFW filters, semantic deduplication methods, and text classifiers to assess data quality. </span></p>

<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Scalability Issues</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python might have problems handling really big projects or websites with lots of visitors. Even though frameworks like Django and Flask can help with this, organizations might need to spend extra time and money making their Python programs work well with lots of people using them.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Dependency Management</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing the different parts that Python needs to work can be hard, especially when there are lots of them. Sometimes, different parts might not work well together because they need different versions or don&#8217;t work with each other. This can make it tricky to make sure everything works smoothly.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Security Concerns</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all programming languages, Python can have problems with security. To keep things safe, organizations should always check for any problems and update their Python programs and parts regularly. It&#8217;s also important to do things like checking the information coming into programs and writing code that&#8217;s safe from attacks to protect against any problems.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Talent Acquisition and Retention</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though more people are using the power of Python, it can still be hard to find people who know it well. Businesses might have trouble to keep and<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-python-developers" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"> hire Python developers</a>, especially when there are lots of other companies looking for them too.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Integration Complexity</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting Python with other systems and tools can be hard, especially when there are lots of different things involved. Businesses might have trouble making sure everything works together smoothly when they&#8217;re using Python with other programs, databases, or services from other <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-python-web-development-companies-that-deliver-staggering-assistance-to-enterprises/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">top Python web development companies</a>.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Community Support and Documentation</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Python has lots of people who use it and a lot of information available, it can still be hard for new developers to find what they need. Businesses might have to spend time helping their developers learn how to use the power of Python well for their projects and give them support along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though there are some tough parts, Python is still a really useful tool for making new things in the digital world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If businesses work on fixing these tough parts and use Python&#8217;s strengths well, they can get past the problems and make the most of Python to come up with new ideas and grow.</span></p>

<h2><b>Best Practices for Leveraging Python in Digital Innovation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use the power of Python well for making new things in the digital world, it&#8217;s important to follow some good ways of working. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These help make sure projects run smoothly, the code is good quality, and everyone can work efficiently. Here are some important things to do when using Python:</span><b></b></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40517 aligncenter" title="Best Practices for Leveraging Python in Digital Innovation" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-Practices-for-Leveraging-Python-in-Digital-Innovation.png" alt="Best Practices for Leveraging Python in Digital Innovation" width="860" height="449" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-Practices-for-Leveraging-Python-in-Digital-Innovation.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-Practices-for-Leveraging-Python-in-Digital-Innovation-300x157.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-Practices-for-Leveraging-Python-in-Digital-Innovation-768x401.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-Practices-for-Leveraging-Python-in-Digital-Innovation-480x251.png 480w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-Practices-for-Leveraging-Python-in-Digital-Innovation-432x225.png 432w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<h3><b>1. Adopt Agile Development Methodologies:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use flexible ways of working like Scrum or Kanban to help teams work well together, be ready to change, and improve quickly. Divide big projects into smaller jobs that are easier to handle, focus on the most important things first, and check regularly if the work is going in the right direction. This helps make sure everyone&#8217;s working towards the same goals and gets the best results.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>2. Use Virtual Environments:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use virtual environments like virtualenv or venv to make separate spaces for Python projects. This keeps things organized and prevents problems when different projects need different things. It also makes sure that the work stays the same from when it&#8217;s being made to when it&#8217;s being tested and used for real.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>3. Follow PEP 8 Guidelines:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow the rules in Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 8 for writing code that&#8217;s easy to read and work with. Make sure to use the same style throughout, give variables names that make sense, and organize the code in a way that makes sense. This helps make sure that everyone can understand and work on the code without any problems.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>4. Leverage Pythonic Idioms:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Python&#8217;s own ways of doing things to write code that&#8217;s short, works well, and follows Python&#8217;s style. Choose list comprehensions instead of loops, use context managers to handle resources, and use the tools that Python already has to make the code easier to read and run faster. This makes sure that the code is written in the best way for utilizing the power of Python and gets things done quickly and efficiently.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>5. Automate Testing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tools like pytest or unit test to automatically check if the code works right. Write tests for small parts of the code, how different parts work together, and how everything works as a whole. This helps make sure the code does what it&#8217;s supposed to do, works well, and doesn&#8217;t have any problems when changes are made. It also helps with keeping track of changes and making sure everything runs smoothly when putting the code into action.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>6. Document Code Effectively:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write comments in the code that explain what&#8217;s happening in a simple and clear way. Use special comments called docstrings to explain what each part of the code does and why it&#8217;s there. Make sure all the comments follow the same style, and use tools like Sphinx to make big documents that explain everything about the project in detail. This helps other people understand the code better and makes it easier to work together.</span><b></b></p>

<hr />
<h3><b>7. Optimize Performance:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find and fix problems that make the code slow using tools like cProfile or line_profiler. Make parts of the code that are really important work faster, use ways of storing data and doing things that work well, and use tricks to remember results from before to make things faster. This helps the code run better and handle more work without slowing down.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>8. Monitor and Debug Applications:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up ways to keep an eye on how the program is working and find problems as soon as they happen. Use tools to check what&#8217;s happening in the program, figure out what went wrong, and fix any issues quickly. Use special tools to look at the code step by step, check what values different parts of the code have, and find out what&#8217;s causing any bugs or problems. This helps make sure the program works well and that any issues get fixed quickly.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>9. Stay Up-to-Date with Python Ecosystem:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay updated on what&#8217;s new and best in the world of Python. Read forums where Python users talk, go to conferences, and join meetings where people talk about Python. This helps you learn about new things, like excellent tools and ways of doing things, that can help you make new stuff in the digital world.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>10. Invest in Continuous Learning:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage your team to keep learning and getting better at using the power of Python and other similar technologies. Give them chances to learn new things, share what they know with each other, and try out new ideas. This helps make sure everyone knows a lot and can come up with new and better ways of doing things in the company.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, businesses are always on the go, so it&#8217;s not just a trend but a must for companies to blend different technologies and platforms together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog post explains all about SharePoint and how to make the most out of combining two big names in tech: Salesforce and SharePoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When SharePoint&#8217;s strong document management features are combined with Salesforce&#8217;s customer relationship management tools, businesses can significantly boost collaboration and productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re thinking about connecting Salesforce with SharePoint but aren&#8217;t sure about the advantages or challenges involved, you&#8217;ll find answers to your questions here.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Does Salesforce SharePoint Integration Mean?</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40487 aligncenter" title="What Does Salesforce SharePoint Integration Mean" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/What-Does-Salesforce-SharePoint-Integration-Mean.jpg" alt="What Does Salesforce SharePoint Integration Mean" width="800" height="371" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/What-Does-Salesforce-SharePoint-Integration-Mean.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/What-Does-Salesforce-SharePoint-Integration-Mean-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/What-Does-Salesforce-SharePoint-Integration-Mean-768x356.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/What-Does-Salesforce-SharePoint-Integration-Mean-480x223.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce is a top-notch platform for managing customer relationships.</span><b> It handles marketing, sales, and customer support effortlessly.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Meanwhile, </span><b>SharePoint is a tool for organizing documents and promoting teamwork</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It allows organizations to share documents, build websites, and keep all files in one place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating Salesforce with SharePoint solves the challenges of external file sharing and document management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this integration, Salesforce can be efficiently managed, making customer relationship management much more convenient.</span><i></i></p>

<h2><b>Do You Really Need to Integrate SharePoint with Salesforce?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/salesforce" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">Salesforce development services</a> let you upload and manage documents, they also have limitations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent these limitations from affecting productivity, companies often turn to document collaboration systems like SharePoint to store documents and facilitate collaborations across the Salesforce integration company.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40488 aligncenter" title="Integrate SharePoint with Salesforce" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Integrate-SharePoint-with-Salesforce.jpg" alt="Integrate SharePoint with Salesforce" width="800" height="398" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Integrate-SharePoint-with-Salesforce.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Integrate-SharePoint-with-Salesforce-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Integrate-SharePoint-with-Salesforce-768x382.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Integrate-SharePoint-with-Salesforce-480x239.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is it really important to integrate these two systems? Let&#8217;s see what happens if you stick solely to using Salesforce for your processes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>File size:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In Salesforce, you can upload documents using two options: &#8220;Attachments,&#8221; which supports files up to 25 MB, and &#8220;File,&#8221; which allows files up to 2 GB. However, managing data larger than this can lead to higher storage costs and slow down system performance over time due to the platform&#8217;s multitenant architecture.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Real-time syncing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Changes made on users&#8217; local drives don&#8217;t automatically sync with Salesforce files, and vice versa. Users must upload or download files and then replace them with the new version, as no real-time syncing option is available.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Document accessibility and privacy:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Salesforce documents can only be accessed by non-Salesforce users through a public URL, which raises concerns about GDPR compliance and other data security laws due to the public sharing of documents. One solution is to purchase additional licenses for non-Salesforce users, which can be costly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>In another scenario, businesses might use Salesforce and SharePoint separately without integrating them. This approach has problems.</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Inefficient process:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Contracts for vendors, customers, and partners often follow the same approval process, which is usually automated within a single workflow management system like SharePoint. However, when it comes to approving contracts, Salesforce users must switch between CRM and SharePoint and vice versa.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Document duplication:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is another issue when Salesforce isn&#8217;t integrated with SharePoint. Typically, the sales team needs to download documents from SharePoint and then upload them to Salesforce whenever they need to share them with their team or clients. This often results in having the same document stored in two systems, causing confusion with file versions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Glitchy team collaboration:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Team collaboration becomes challenging when customer records are stored in Salesforce, but collaboration occurs across both SharePoint and Salesforce. This leads to Salesforce users spending time switching between systems to stay connected with their teams, causing inefficiencies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Content desertion:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Content abandonment occurs when sales teams copy links to SharePoint files in Salesforce but cannot preview or locate them using Salesforce&#8217;s global search. Consequently, valuable content for customer communication ends up buried within SharePoint libraries.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we&#8217;ve explored the drawbacks of not integrating SharePoint and Salesforce, let&#8217;s understand the clear benefits of establishing integration before we proceed to the integration steps.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40489 aligncenter" title="Benefits of Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce.jpg" alt="Benefits of Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce" width="800" height="302" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-768x290.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-480x181.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><b>1. Enhanced Teamwork</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce improves collaboration not only among sales and service teams but also across departments like marketing and legal. Let&#8217;s explore the benefits of customizing Salesforce with some examples. For instance, picture a situation where a sales executive and a content writer collaborate on crafting a client proposal. With Salesforce integrated with SharePoint, any edits made by the sales executive to the writer&#8217;s document will instantly show up for all team members with access to the document. This ensures everyone stays updated and minimizes the chance of version control issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example is, suppose a legal team examines and approves a contract stored in SharePoint. Once approved, the sales executive can immediately see these changes in Salesforce. This ensures the sales team stays informed when communicating important updates to clients.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>2. Improved System Performance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major advantage of integrating Salesforce with SharePoint is the enhancement in load balancing. Using each platform separately can strain the systems, resulting in more downtime and slower performance. However, integrating them allows for sharing data and files between the two platforms, leading to better load balancing and eliminating resource wastage from duplications and managing multiple copies.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>3. Analytics and Reporting</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating SharePoint with Salesforce makes analytical and reporting tasks simpler. Data from both platforms can be merged to gain insights into sales performance, document usage, and customer interactions. For instance, using the SharePoint Online Reporting and Auditing tool, teams can analyze frequently accessed documents in the sales process. This provides valuable insights into the resources that have the greatest impact on closing deals or addressing customer issues.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>4. Enhanced Document Security</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating Salesforce with SharePoint provides businesses with access to SharePoint&#8217;s strong security features, such as teams, roles, and permission levels. This helps them comply with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Additionally, the platform allows setting expiration dates for specific files, ensuring that third-party vendors cannot access the file after the expiration date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These four are just the main benefits of Salesforce Sharepoint integration. On a more practical level, there are several other advantages that emerge in day-to-day processes and workflows, including external sharing controls, enhanced data management, increased productivity, and scalability.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The likelihood of experiencing these benefits in your organization hinges on how effectively you execute Salesforce SharePoint integration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before getting into that section, let&#8217;s provide a quick overview of the four guiding principles that can ensure the success of the process.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Principles for Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the current digital economy, successful integrations are vital for creating a productive and efficient organization. Achieving this requires following certain principles or tips for successful Salesforce Sharepoint integration.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40490 aligncenter" title="Key Principles for Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Principles-for-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce.jpg" alt="Key Principles for Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce" width="800" height="264" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Principles-for-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Principles-for-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-300x99.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Principles-for-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-768x253.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Principles-for-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-480x158.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data Location:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&#8217;s important to make sure that data stays within its designated geographic boundaries: where it was made, where it will be used, and where it will be kept. This is especially crucial when complying with regulations concerning privacy and data storage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data Organization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The data you utilize, along with its architecture, should be logically arranged and structured to optimize the integration process. This typically involves labeling, categorizing, and connecting related data points across both Salesforce and SharePoint.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Security:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When integrating SharePoint and Salesforce, prioritize security above all else. While both platforms have strong security measures in place, it&#8217;s important to focus on permissions for file access and tracking their Sharepoint application development usage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data Distribution:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once data is properly organized and stored, the next step is to plan how it will be accessed and shared. SharePoint offers several features, including setting expiration dates for documents and a dashboard to monitor who has accessed a document.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we&#8217;ve covered the principles of integrating Salesforce and SharePoint let&#8217;s explore the process of connecting the two platforms and any limitations you should be aware of.</span></p>

<h2><b>Step-by-Step Guide to Integrating SharePoint with Salesforce</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the process of integrating Salesforce and Sharepoint, you&#8217;ll generally have three options:</span><b> Using Files Connect, custom tools for Salesforce Sharepoint integration, or utilizing third-party platforms </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to link the two systems. Let&#8217;s get into the details of these options.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40491 aligncenter" title="Step by Step Guide to Integrating SharePoint with Salesforce" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Integrating-SharePoint-with-Salesforce.jpg" alt="Step by Step Guide to Integrating SharePoint with Salesforce" width="800" height="295" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Integrating-SharePoint-with-Salesforce.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Integrating-SharePoint-with-Salesforce-300x111.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Integrating-SharePoint-with-Salesforce-768x283.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Integrating-SharePoint-with-Salesforce-480x177.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><b>Method 1: Using the Salesforce Files Connect SharePoint Method</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, go to the Salesforce AppExchange and search for &#8220;Files Connect.&#8221; Then, click on the &#8220;Get It Now&#8221; button to start the installation process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After installing, navigate to the &#8220;Permission Sets&#8221; section in the Salesforce setup menu. Select &#8220;Files Connect&#8221; and assign appropriate user permissions, such as viewing, editing, and deleting files.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, set up an authentication provider by going to &#8220;Authentication Provider&#8221; and choosing &#8220;Files Connect.&#8221; Here, you can create and manage necessary settings, such as authentication type and users granted access.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, configure the SharePoint account by navigating to the &#8220;SharePoint&#8221; section and choosing &#8220;Files Connect.&#8221; Here, you can input the required information, such as login credentials and SharePoint URL.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it&#8217;s time to configure <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/sharepoint-application-development-services-company" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">SharePoint application development</a> services. Navigate to the &#8220;Develop&#8221; section of the Salesforce setup menu and choose &#8220;Files Connect.&#8221; Here, you can configure the necessary settings, such as the type of integration and the data that will be shared between the systems.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next important step for integrating Salesforce with SharePoint is to set up the Salesforce Files Connect tool. Go to the &#8220;Setup&#8221; section in the Salesforce menu and select &#8220;Files Connect.&#8221; Here, you can configure settings such as the integration type and the data that will be shared between the systems.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step of integrating Salesforce with SharePoint is to create a connection between the two platforms. To do this, go to the &#8220;External Data Sources&#8221; section in the Salesforce setup menu and select &#8220;Files Connect.&#8221; Here, you can configure settings such as the integration type and the data that will be shared between the systems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this method is commonly used for integrating Salesforce and SharePoint, there are some concerning limitations with Files Connect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These include limited support for external systems, lack of upload options, absence of permission controls, complexity in external sharing, latency issues, and search limitations.</span></p>

<h3><b>Method 2: Third-Party Applications for Salesforce to SharePoint Integration</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple third-party connectors aim to address the limitations of Files Connect. Below is a comparison table outlining the differences between Files Connect and these alternatives.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40492 aligncenter" title="Third Party Applications for Salesforce to SharePoint Integration" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Third-Party-Applications-for-Salesforce-to-SharePoint-Integration.jpg" alt="Third Party Applications for Salesforce to SharePoint Integration" width="800" height="810" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Third-Party-Applications-for-Salesforce-to-SharePoint-Integration.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Third-Party-Applications-for-Salesforce-to-SharePoint-Integration-296x300.jpg 296w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Third-Party-Applications-for-Salesforce-to-SharePoint-Integration-768x778.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Third-Party-Applications-for-Salesforce-to-SharePoint-Integration-457x463.jpg 457w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><b>Method 3: Custom Integration Tool for SharePoint and Salesforce</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final choice businesses often make for Salesforce and SharePoint online integration is to create a custom tool.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you&#8217;re aware of the three typical options available when considering SharePoint integration with Salesforce, we want to equip you with insight into some common challenges that may arise regardless of the integration model you choose.</span></p>
<h2><b>Common Challenges in Integrating SharePoint with Salesforce and How to Overcome Them</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating SharePoint with Salesforce can be a challenging process for many businesses that are not familiar with the technical aspects of combining these two large platforms.</span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40493 aligncenter" title="Common Challenges in Integrating SharePoint" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Common-Challenges-in-Integrating-SharePoint.jpg" alt="Common Challenges in Integrating SharePoint" width="800" height="269" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Common-Challenges-in-Integrating-SharePoint.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Common-Challenges-in-Integrating-SharePoint-300x101.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Common-Challenges-in-Integrating-SharePoint-768x258.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Common-Challenges-in-Integrating-SharePoint-480x161.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><b>1. Data Migration</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving data between Salesforce and SharePoint, or vice versa, can be very complex and time-consuming. Businesses need to ensure that their data is correctly formatted, organized, and transferred without any errors like duplication or inaccuracies. To tackle this challenge, they can utilize third-party data migration tools or enlist specialized data migration services to assist with the process.</span><br />
<b></b></p>
<h3><b>2. Customization</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customizing the integration and its outcomes is very challenging when using the Files Connect method. The absence of customization options often leads businesses to either opt for a third-party solution or collaborate with a software development firm to create a custom integration tool.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>3. Data Security</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securing sensitive data and limiting access to authorized users is crucial for a successful Salesforce SharePoint integration. We suggest addressing this by implementing Salesforce Sharepoint integration with security measures such as firewalls, encryption, and access controls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, we&#8217;ve explored various aspects of integrating Salesforce with SharePoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We discussed why relying solely on Salesforce&#8217;s document management feature may not meet the needs of an expanding business and outlined the reasons behind it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, we highlighted the key benefits of integration, discussed the available options for combining the two platforms, and finally, addressed the potential challenges in Salesforce Sharepoint integration you may encounter.</span></p>

<p><b>Salesforce Einstein is a collection of AI tools for CRM that helps create personalized and predictive experiences, making your company look more professional and attractive. </b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant moment happened at the 2023 Dreamforce event, where a new version of Einstein was presented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A better way of understanding AI was introduced, by making it more dependable, fair, and available to all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not by chance that the main theme of the event was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now everyone is an Einstein: Data + AI + CRM + Trust.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is how Einstein has become the most trusted AI in CRM. It has made many improvements and introduced new solutions. </span></p>

<h3><b>1. Resistance to Change</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some workers might not like using new technology or changing how they do things.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking openly about it and showing why Salesforce Einstein is good can help them feel better about it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering comprehensive training and ongoing support can boost confidence and promote acceptance among team members.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>2. Data Quality Issues</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad data quality can cause Einstein&#8217;s AI to not work well.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making clear rules about how data is handled is very important to make sure it&#8217;s clean and right.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking and cleaning data often keeps it good over time, so Einstein&#8217;s ideas stay helpful.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>3. Integration Complexity</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connecting Salesforce Einstein with other systems and apps might be hard.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working closely together with IT teams, consultants, and vendors is very important to make sure the connection goes well.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leveraging resources provided by Salesforce, such as documentation and support, can aid in promptly resolving integration issues.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>4. Limited Understanding of AI</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some workers might not know much about AI and how it fits into their jobs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving them learning materials and training sessions can help them learn more about AI.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showing real-life examples of how AI can make their work better can help them see why it&#8217;s important.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>5.  Ensuring Data Privacy and Security</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using AI tools like Salesforce Einstein means dealing with important customer information, which makes data privacy and security very important.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having strong security rules and following the right laws is crucial to keep customer data safe and follow the rules.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching workers the best ways to handle data and follow security rules helps reduce risks and stop any possible problems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By dealing with these problems early and putting the right plans in place, companies can get past obstacles and make the most of Salesforce Einstein to help their business succeed.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40081 aligncenter" title="Monolithic Application What is it" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Monolithic-Application-What-is-it.jpg" alt="Monolithic Application What is it" width="800" height="449" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Monolithic-Application-What-is-it.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Monolithic-Application-What-is-it-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Monolithic-Application-What-is-it-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Monolithic-Application-What-is-it-480x269.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><b>A monolithic architecture application is a type of software in which all the app’s components and gatherings are interconnected and reliant on each other</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Simply put, the app is completely developed and deployed on a single unit, having all the coders and resources connected together.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such applications, even a basic change for modernization can impact the overall application, which may further require a completed redeployment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we move towards the steps of modernizing monolithic applications, let’s understand the challenges or flaws of legacy apps for modernization. It will help you make a better solution.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Challenges of a Monolithic Application</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the common challenges faced in legacy systems having monolithic architecture include:</span><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40082 aligncenter" title="Challenges of a Monolithic Application" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Challenges-of-a-Monolithic-Application.jpg" alt="Challenges of a Monolithic Application" width="800" height="497" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Challenges-of-a-Monolithic-Application.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Challenges-of-a-Monolithic-Application-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Challenges-of-a-Monolithic-Application-768x477.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Challenges-of-a-Monolithic-Application-480x298.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><b>1. Limited Scalability</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve already stated earlier, scaling legacy apps can be challenging as the business grows. Even a single change in any one part may impact the complete systems and require a complete application redeployment.</span><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>2. Dependency Management</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A legacy system upgrade is also necessary because these apps have some dependencies between components. In most cases, managing and upgrading these dependencies can be troubling.</span><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>3. Lack of Agility</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legacy application migration and modernization are often slow to transform. This can impact businesses and make it complicated to meet changing market trends and dynamic user requirements quickly.</span><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>4. Expensive Updates</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve already pointed out, every component is interconnected, therefore, even a single change may lead to redeployment. This can be a expensive process for businesses. </span><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>5. One-point failure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge that engineers face with monolithic legacy systems is one-point failure. This means a single glitch in one component may bring down everything available in the application, since all the components are interlinked to each other, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading all these challenges, are you feeling annoyed by these limitations with monolithic applications?</span></p>

<h2><strong>Understanding Application Modernization and the Cloud</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we get into the details, let’s first understand what application modernization strategy is.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40083 aligncenter" title="Understanding Application Modernization and the Cloud" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Understanding-Application-Modernization-and-the-Cloud.jpg" alt="Understanding Application Modernization and the Cloud" width="800" height="489" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Understanding-Application-Modernization-and-the-Cloud.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Understanding-Application-Modernization-and-the-Cloud-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Understanding-Application-Modernization-and-the-Cloud-768x469.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Understanding-Application-Modernization-and-the-Cloud-480x293.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/glossary/application-modernization" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b>Cognizant</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Application modernization is the process of updating legacy applications to scalable, cloud-native app environments by using modern technology stacks. Through this process, applications can continue to meet modern user expectations as they evolve. “</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we break this definition, this basically includes two parts, the first is </span><b>migration </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the second is </span><b>cloud</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, modernizing monolithic applications is majorly dependent on these two crucial components.</span></p>
<p><b>Migration is the process of moving an app from its existing environment to a new one, for instance cloud</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Whereas, the cloud is a group of remote resources or servers that can be accessed using the Internet. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This offers a scalable and flexible infrastructure for accessing and hosting applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud is commonly used for modernizing monolithic applications due to digital transformation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unlocking-business-acceleration-in-a-hybrid-cloud-world" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b>McKinsey</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has an interesting take, it says monolithic apps must be migrated or modernized to the cloud in order to stay relevant in today’s digital ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the basic purpose of modernizing monolithic application is restructuring the legacy system coder to make it easily understandable. This can be further quickly updated to meet future business requirements.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Streamlining Applications from Monolithic Architecture to the Cloud</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40084 aligncenter" title="Streamlining Applications from Monolithic Architecture to the Cloud" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Streamlining-Applications-from-Monolithic-Architecture-to-the-Cloud.jpg" alt="Streamlining Applications from Monolithic Architecture to the Cloud" width="800" height="346" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Streamlining-Applications-from-Monolithic-Architecture-to-the-Cloud.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Streamlining-Applications-from-Monolithic-Architecture-to-the-Cloud-300x130.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Streamlining-Applications-from-Monolithic-Architecture-to-the-Cloud-768x332.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Streamlining-Applications-from-Monolithic-Architecture-to-the-Cloud-480x208.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be wondering how to move old applications to the cloud and smoothly connect them to the digital world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned before, the major challenge of monolithic apps is their rigidity and inflexible nature. Such type of architecture makes the application opaque to the outside world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such cases, despite being able to see the inputs and outputs, there is no transparency about the application’s internal process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of legacy applications should be kept separately by migrating them to an open-source cloud environment. This will allow interoperability with other cloud services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, legacy monolithic codes usually need to be refactored into microservices.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What are Microservices?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b>Amazon AWS</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explains: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.”</span></i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40085 aligncenter" title="What are Microservices" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-are-Microservices.jpg" alt="What are Microservices" width="800" height="525" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-are-Microservices.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-are-Microservices-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-are-Microservices-768x504.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-are-Microservices-480x315.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main highlight of this definition consists of two key terms, “small” and self-contained teams”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a state-of-the-art approach that includes splitting monolithic applications into smaller components. These components communicate with each other and perform particular functions using well-defined <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/api-development-services" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">API development services</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system ensures flexible and <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/agile-consulting" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">agile consulting services</a> by developing, deploying, and scaling microservices independently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microservices are similar to building blocks that are arranged in multiple ways to build <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-development" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">custom app solutions</a>. In this context, each microservice takes care of a specific task like user authentication, processing payments, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These integrations can be developed in various frameworks or programming languages. Additionally, they can even be hosted on multiple servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By microservices migration from monolithic apps, businesses can develop applications that are cloud-native, modern and can be scaled easily for changing business needs. These microservice applications will be:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scalable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resilient</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fault-tolerant</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitate maintenance and updates smoothly</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamental goal of modernizing legacy applications is to preserve the functionality of the original application while breaking down a monolithic codebase into a group of microservices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That raises a question, how is that possible, given the complexity and lack of documentation of monolithic codes?</span></p>
<h2><strong>A Proven Approach for Refactoring Monolithic Codes to Microservices</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When researching modernizing monolithic applications, we found that Gartner has a three-step process of evaluation with </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-options-to-modernize-legacy-systems" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven options to modernize legacy systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from monolithic to microservices. Let’s explore them in detail.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40086 aligncenter" title="A Proven Approach for Refactoring Monolithic Codes to Microservices" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Proven-Approach-for-Refactoring-Monolithic-Codes-to-Microservices.jpg" alt="A Proven Approach for Refactoring Monolithic Codes to Microservices" width="800" height="333" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Proven-Approach-for-Refactoring-Monolithic-Codes-to-Microservices.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Proven-Approach-for-Refactoring-Monolithic-Codes-to-Microservices-300x125.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Proven-Approach-for-Refactoring-Monolithic-Codes-to-Microservices-768x320.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Proven-Approach-for-Refactoring-Monolithic-Codes-to-Microservices-480x200.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>Step 1: Evaluate the Suitability of Your Legacy Systems</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to thoroughly assess the microservices architecture to understand whether is is suitable for your applications or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes evaluating the crucial players for adopting microservices, like scalability, agility, and fault tolerance. If your legacy application is not capable of offering these, the legacy application modernization becomes necessary to provide better value for your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, businesses also consider the complexity, cost, and security risk of their monolithic apps for evaluation. Modernization could be essential if you find complex technology and scalability for preventive costs.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40087 aligncenter" title="Evaluate your Legacy System" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Evaluate-your-Legacy-System.jpg" alt="Evaluate your Legacy System" width="800" height="393" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Evaluate-your-Legacy-System.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Evaluate-your-Legacy-System-300x147.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Evaluate-your-Legacy-System-768x377.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Evaluate-your-Legacy-System-480x236.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>1. Rehosting </b></span></h4>
<h5><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>What is it?</b></span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rehosting, also known as lift and sift migration, is moving the monolithic application to a new hosting environment. It can either be physical, virtual, or cloud migration. This does not require modifying the code, features, or functions.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rehosting approach can be considered when businesses wish to improve security, scalability, and reliability. Based on specific business requirements, it can be done on-premises or in the cloud.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>2. Refactoring</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refactoring is the approach of optimizing the current code to remove coding debt and improve non-functional features. In short, it includes restructuring the app’s code to a microservices architecture without making changes to its external behavior.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach can be used to improve application performance or make it feature-rich to increase the app’s value. This is a simple option as it does not require major changes; however, it can be time-consuming.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>3. Replatforming</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replatforming is an option for moving the monolithic application to a new runtime platform. When opting for this, you can make a few changes, but not to the code structure, features, and functionalities.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach can be used by businesses for modernizing monolithic applications for scalability enhancement and to improve application agility.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>4. Rearchitect</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, when using the rearchitect option to modernize monolithic applications, you modify the code to move it to a new application architecture and utilize new and better capabilities.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This option can be suitable for making your existing app more modular and scalable. Using this, you can deploy independently by breaking down your monolithic code into smaller and more manageable components. It can also help microservices to enhance agility.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>5. Rebuild</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebuild, also called redesign or rewrite. It is an option to rewrite the monolithic application from scratch using modern cloud-native technologies and frameworks, while preserving scope and specifications.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach helps businesses modernize existing applications while improving scalability, agility, and reliability. </span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>6. Encapsulate</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this option,<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/cloud-services/microservices-and-containerization" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"> microservices and containerization services</a> can be used to deploy as a single component of a smaller or independent module. Each module here can run in its container, providing scalability and flexibility compared to legacy architecture.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modernizing monolithic applications using containerization can make your application and its dependencies easy to manage. However, when using this approach, businesses may not fully take the benefits of microservices architecture.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>7. Replace</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is often considered as the final or last option. This approach, as the name suggests is replacing the monolithic application entirely with a new application using different and modern technologies and frameworks. The new application is usually built based on the new requirements and needs.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing will help businesses modernize the monolithic application to improve scalability and reliability. This involves using cloud-native technologies and adopting a microservice architecture.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Evaluate the Pros and Cons</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have finalized the modernization approach, it&#8217;s time to assess the pros and cons of adopting a microservices architecture. Some major benefits include enhanced scalability, agility, and fault tolerance. However, this could also lead to increased complexity and the need for new operational processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, modernizing monolithic applications finally comes down to selecting the right option based on the business’ needs. It is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of all the options and make a choice based on the desired result for the growth of your business.</span></p>

<h3><strong>1. Know What You Need </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start looking for Salesforce integration services, figure out your goal and what you want to achieve with Salesforce. This will help you find Salesforce implementation experts who meet your needs.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you know your goal, start searching for a Salesforce application development company with the right skills and experience. Look for Salesforce business development companies with a good reputation and a proven track of successful projects. This helps ensure you&#8217;ll get quality service.</span></p>

<h3><strong>4. Check References</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read reviews and talk to the company’s past clients to learn about their developer&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses. This gives you a better idea of what to expect and helps you decide if they fit your business.</span></p>
<h3><strong>5. Contemplate  the Cost</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you understand the pricing structure before you commit. Look for a Salesforce business development company that offers fair prices and transparent billing. This helps you avoid any surprises down the road.</span></p>
<h3><strong>6. Consider Ongoing Support</strong></h3>

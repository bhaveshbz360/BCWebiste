PHP Vs. Java Vs. Python – Which Language Is Better For Web Development?</a></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SQL injection vulnerabilities typically arise in PHP when web applications construct SQL queries by concatenating user-supplied input with SQL commands. For instance, if a malicious user inputs SQL code into one of these fields, the application may execute the code, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or other criminal activities.</span></p>
<h3>Protection measures:</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use prepared statements and parameterized queries instead of dynamic SQL statements to prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL code.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">When you <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-php-developers?utm_source=ValueCoders+-+securing-php-web-apps&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire PHP developers</a>, ask them to validate and sanitize user input to ensure that it contains only expected characters and formats.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before processing input, use input validation techniques to check for unforeseen input, such as erroneous data types or values.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into a web page viewed by other users. It happens when an application fails to sanitize user input correctly, allowing the attacker to insert harmful code such as JavaScript, HTML, or other scripting languages. When a victim visits the web page with the injected code, the malicious code can execute and potentially steal sensitive information or hijack the user&#8217;s session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">XSS attacks can be particularly dangerous because they can bypass authentication controls, allowing an attacker to access sensitive information without needing a valid login. Web applications written in PHP are commonly targeted for XSS attacks, making it essential to implement proper input sanitization and validation techniques to prevent this type of vulnerability.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Protection measures:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use output encoding techniques to prevent attackers from injecting malicious scripts into web pages.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask </span>custom PHP development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> provider to implement strict content security policies that prevent scripts from being executed from external sources.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before processing input, use techniques for input validation to look for unforeseen input, such as erroneous data types or values.</span></li>

    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
<h2><strong>Vulnerability 3: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a security vulnerability. In a CSRF attack, a hacker can trick a user into executing unintended actions on a web application. This can happen when the user visits a malicious website or clicks on a link or button that contains a hidden request to the target application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the user is already authenticated to the target application, the attacker can use the session to perform unauthorized actions on the user&#8217;s behalf. For example, they can change the user&#8217;s password, transfer money from their account, or delete important data.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Protection measures:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One should implement strict authentication and permission rules to guarantee that only authorized users may access the website and take action there.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers?utm_source=ValueCoders+-+securing-php-web-apps&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire software developers</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ask them to use CSRF tokens to confirm that the user, not an attacker, made the request.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use input validation techniques to screen input for unforeseen elements, such as erroneous data types or values, before processing it.</span></li>
</ul>

PHP: Choosing The Right Stack For Software Development</a></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Vulnerability 4: Authentication and Session Management</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authentication vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the methods used to verify the identity of users, which can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. For example, an application that does not correctly validate user input during login could be vulnerable to a brute force attack, where an attacker tries many username/password combinations until they find one that works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Session management vulnerabilities refer to how web applications manage and maintain user sessions. If an attacker can hijack a user&#8217;s session, they can impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf, such as changing their account settings or making unauthorized purchases. It can happen if the application uses predictable session IDs or if the session timeout is too long, among other factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both authentication and session management vulnerabilities are common in PHP applications and can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause other types of harm. Developers need to be aware of these vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security measures to protect against them.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Protection measures:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employ two-factor authentication and strict password policies to make sure that only authorized users may access the system.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Store user passwords securely, using strong encryption techniques and hashing algorithms.</span></li>
<li>Use PHP secure session management techniques to prevent session hijackings, such as session timeouts and regeneration of session IDs after each login.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Vulnerability 5: File Upload Vulnerabilities</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">File upload vulnerabilities are security issues that can occur in web applications, including those built using PHP. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to upload files, such as scripts or malware, to a server by exploiting weaknesses in the application&#8217;s file upload functionality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once uploaded, one can execute the malicious files on the server, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions. For example, an attacker could upload a PHP file that contains malicious code, which could be executed on the server, giving the attacker control over the affected system.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Protection measures:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement strict file type and size restrictions to prevent users from uploading malicious files.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scan uploaded files for viruses and malware using a reputable antivirus software to keep </span>PHP protected<span style="font-weight: 400;"> against threats.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Store uploaded files in a separate directory with restricted permissions to prevent unauthorized access and execution.</span></li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Vulnerability 6: Server Misconfiguration</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server misconfiguration can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. For example, a server may have weak passwords, incorrect file permissions, or other configuration errors that make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system. These misconfigurations occur when a server is not properly set up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One can exploit these vulnerabilities to steal sensitive data, modify system configurations, or even take complete control of the affected system. Server administrators must ensure their systems are correctly configured to minimize the risk of these attacks.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Protection measures:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regularly review server configurations and ensure that they follow </span>PHP security best practices and guidelines.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Disable unnecessary services and ports to reduce the attack surface.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regularly patch and update software and systems to address known vulnerabilities and security issues.</span></li>

    </div>
<h2><strong>Vulnerability 7: Code Injection</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code injection is a common vulnerability in PHP applications that allows attackers to insert and execute malicious code into the application. This can occur when an application fails to properly sanitize user input, such as data entered into a form or URL parameters, before using it to construct dynamic SQL queries, system commands, or other types of code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the attacker successfully injects the malicious code, they can use it to steal sensitive information, take control of the application or server, or perform other malicious activities. Code injection attacks can be particularly dangerous because they can occur without the user&#8217;s knowledge and can be challenging to detect.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Protection measures:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use input validation and sanitization techniques to ensure user input contains only expected characters and formats.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">To keep PHP secure, avoid using eval() or other dynamic code execution functions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use security-focused frameworks and libraries that protect against code injection attacks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Vulnerability 8: Broken Access Control</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broken access control vulnerabilities in PHP refer to security weaknesses that can allow attackers to access resources or perform actions that should be restricted. This can happen when the authentication and authorization controls are not adequately implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass access controls and gain access to confidential information, modify data, or perform other actions that they should not be able to do. For example, suppose a user can access a web application page or functionality without being properly authenticated or authorized. In that case, it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or allow the user to perform malicious actions.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Protection measures:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish stringent access control regulations to ensure that only authorized users can access critical resources.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Use PHP secure authentication and authorization methods, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication, to ensure user identity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduct regular security audits to identify and address access control vulnerabilities.</span></li>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Vulnerability 9: Insecure Direct Object References</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An insecure direct object reference is a vulnerability that arises when a web application doesn&#8217;t correctly validate user input or enforce access controls while accessing internal objects such as files or database records. Due to this vulnerability, attackers may manipulate or tamper with the parameters of a request to access unauthorized resources or data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, if an application uses sequential numbering to identify files, an attacker can manipulate the number in the request and access a file they shouldn&#8217;t have access to. This can result in the disclosure of confidential information or unauthorized access to critical resources. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Protection measures:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement proper access controls to limit access to internal objects only to authorized users.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use indirect object references that map internal objects to public references, ensuring one cannot access internal objects directly.</span></li>
<li>Conduct regular PHP security audits to identify and address insecure direct object reference vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Vulnerability 10: Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insufficient logging and monitoring is a security vulnerability in PHP applications when proper logging and monitoring mechanisms are lacking. This means the application fails to record important events or activities, and there is no way to detect security incidents or malicious activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attackers can exploit this weakness by performing actions that are not logged or monitored, allowing them to evade detection and continue their attacks. For example, an attacker could use a vulnerability in the application to steal sensitive data, and the lack of logging and monitoring could prevent the attack from being detected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proper logging and monitoring mechanisms are essential for detecting and responding to security incidents. By monitoring the activity and events within an application, security teams can quickly identify and respond to threats, preventing further damage to the system or compromise of sensitive information.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Protection measures:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement robust logging and monitoring capabilities to detect and alert on suspicious activities and security incidents.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define clear incident response procedures and train personnel on how to respond to security incidents.</span></li>
<li>Conduct regular PHP security audits to identify and address insufficient logging and monitoring vulnerabilities.</li>

<h2><strong>Best Practices for Secure PHP Web App Development</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30362" title="How to secure PHP Web Apps" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3.jpg" alt="How to secure PHP Web Apps" width="1200" height="720" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3.jpg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>PHP web application security demands a proactive, all-encompassing strategy that tackles possible vulnerabilities from the beginning. PHP security best practices should be created and maintained using the following:</p>
<h3><strong>Regular Updates and Patches</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequent upgrades and patches must maintain the security and integrity of PHP web applications. Although older versions of PHP and other dependencies can include known vulnerabilities, developers should ensure they build their applications on the most recent versions of such components. Developers should also often evaluate and implement security fixes to reduce possible vulnerabilities.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Code Reviews and Penetration Testing</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to find and fix possible </span>PHP security<span style="font-weight: 400;"> flaws in web applications is through code reviews and penetration testing. A code review can help developers find security problems early in the development process so they can fix them before the program goes online. On the other side, penetration testing entails simulating assaults on the program to find potential weaknesses that attackers may use.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Secure Configuration and Server Hardening</strong></h3>
<p>The security of a PHP web application must be maintained by adequately setting the server and protecting it from potential attacks. It also entails putting in place safe server setups with firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and SSL encryption. In addition, developers should periodically check their servers for possible vulnerabilities and apply PHP security fixes as necessary.</p>
<h3><strong>Educating Developers and Users on Security Best Practices</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help prevent possible security dangers, one must train developers and users on </span>PHP security best practice<span style="font-weight: 400;">s. Developers should adhere to secure coding best practices, frameworks, and tools. Users should be instructed on the proper use of passwords and given the go-ahead to create secure passwords, turn on multi-factor authentication, and keep their login information private.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Input Validation and Sanitization</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers should always validate and sanitize user input to ensure it meets the expected criteria and prevent attackers from injecting malicious code. They can do this by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using server-side validation and sanitization libraries </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using built-in PHP functions such as  `filter_var()` and `htmlspecialchars()`.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Least Privilege Principle</strong></h3>
<p>The least privilege principle involves providing users and applications with the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. This lowers the potential attack surface and decreases the harm a PHP security breach may inflict. Users should only have the rights they need to do their duties, and developers should make sure their programs adhere to the concept of least privilege.</p>
<h3><strong>Secure Password Storage</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storing passwords securely is critical for protecting user data. Developers should use strong encryption algorithms and hashing functions such as bcrypt or Argon2 to store passwords. Additionally, developers should never store passwords in plaintext and avoid using common passwords or easily guessable passwords.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Access Control and Authentication</strong></h3>
<p>Proper access control and authentication mechanisms are crucial for maintaining PHP security for web applications. Developers should ensure that users are authenticated before accessing sensitive data or performing critical actions. Additionally, developers should implement role-based access control to limit user access to specific features or resources.</p>
<h3><strong>Use of Security Frameworks and Libraries</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers should think about utilizing security frameworks and libraries that are tried and trusted for being secure. These frameworks and libraries can offer extra security features and functionalities including encryption, secure session management, and user authentication and authorization.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--h3">In today’s digital era, your business is completely dependent on Web and Mobile applications. Therefore, application support and maintenance services appear to be a primary concern to get things going. Now, you must be thinking, why should you do that? Well, let’s dive deep, then.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Think About The Following Issues</span></strong></p>
<ol class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Who takes care of your website, software, and apps when they crash?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Who resolves the issue when they catch a bug?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Do you update your website, software, or apps at the right time?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">What will you do when your Website gets hacked?</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outsource a good IT company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop their applications, but they forget about the app maintenance or do not care about it after creating the app. Ultimately, this results in business loss as the app stops functioning and engaging customers like it was previously doing. So focus more on Application Maintenance. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So, What Is Application Maintenance?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Application Maintenance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is just the same as that of your car servicing. You need to take good care of it, including replacing old functionalities with new ones and keeping things in order so that the app doesn&#8217;t display errors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are wondering what application maintenance means for the business world, you just need to understand that it is a practice employed by business owners and managers to keep their applications updated with new features, functionalities, and security patches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, application development and maintenance help fix technical glitches or system errors as soon as they appear. There are many models for application maintenance, but it&#8217;s an ongoing process with a strong relationship between the business and IT team members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model may vary with different app types or systems that you have to keep updated for optimum performance. Let&#8217;s discuss different ‌models for application maintenance practices:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Onsite Model/ On-Premise Solution: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model involves allocating resources to manage servers and other IT infrastructure that business organizations use on-premises. This works well when there is no predetermined service level agreement with the provider.</span></li>
<li><b>On Cloud Model/SaaS Solution: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model is used to deploy SAAS on the cloud, which includes allocating resources for IT infrastructure externally that third-party providers manage &amp; business organizations use it just like they use any other internet services (emails or social media account). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works well when there is a predetermined service level agreement with the provider. </span></li>
<li><b>Managed Model/MSP Solution:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In this model, business organizations allocate resources for IT infrastructure and keep it managed by providers or third-party professionals skilled in handling such services on the cloud. This way of mobile app maintenance services helps to focus more on core business tasks and stay ahead in the competition.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Deloitte report says that 60% of the outsourcers prefer to hire Application Maintenance &amp; support.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Bug Fixing</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Bugs are common when developing and maintaining websites. When bugs enter code, they can cause issues in your application’s functionality or, even worse — render it completely useless!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The most frequent type of bug is an error that occurs during last-minute changes to a product’s source code; these usually originate from buggy third-party tools used by web entrepreneurs, as well as failures to use version control systems effectively enough (which we all know isn’t easy).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Application maintenance is not an easy process that can be handover to any application maintenance company without rigorous thought. Bugs can be introduced at any time during the coding of your application, making it crucial to regularly test and retest for defects or glitches in order to maintain a stable product.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, the product won’t turn away customers with bugs. Website entrepreneurs who develop online products must take care when updating their websites’ code because doing so could result in some unexpected errors being displayed by visitors on the screen, which may irritate them greatly if they’re trying to just get serious work done instead!</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nAivJkW8GEgeT89g" alt="Bug Fixing" width="800" height="572" data-image-id="0*nAivJkW8GEgeT89g" data-width="860" data-height="615" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Bugs, like any other animal in the wild, can be a hazard to your application’s functionality. Bugs may occur and cause hindrances to how it performs its tasks, or even make things worse for no apparent reason at all!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is important not only because bugs might inconvenience you, but also because they bring down quality by taking up time from developers who could otherwise spend their days making better products instead (and we know that 5% — 10% bug elimination costs happen more often than not).</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Save Time and Money</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you trust your IT infrastructure and application management team for mobile app maintenance services, time becomes a much more valuable resource. When the professionals at this company run efficient systems for saving resources on core business processes in order to maximize profit margins while maintaining peak performance — they always have one goal: customer satisfaction!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">At the same time, several companies are struggling because these old legacy apps aren’t being phased out fast enough, which means there continues exposure into other critical areas like data backup or disaster recovery plans.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">All potential weaknesses must be identified during both web and mobile <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-maintenance" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>application maintenance</strong></a> services, which could lead back to becoming reputed by hackers, should be safeguarded against with professional help from expert technicians who specialize specifically when it comes down to running powerful software without any issues whatsoever.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Need For Specialists</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Maintaining an IT infrastructure is no easy task, but it becomes even more challenging when you need to find skilled specialists. This leaves your company with less time for other necessary projects and may lead them to further complications down the line.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Application support and maintenance services can provide these full-time staff members that are needed in order to keep up engineering tools within organizations where internal teams often fail because of insufficient manpower or conflicting priorities between different departments, which causes errors on their part leading to downtime wreaking havoc among all types of businesses worldwide.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Experiencing Change</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The IT world is a tumultuous place. The changes are always coming at an unexpected rate, and you never know what’s going to be thrown your way next — but with application management on board, all those problems disappear!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Application development and maintenance managers will take care of everything from updating applications automatically or by request; they’ve seen it before, so there’s no need for concern when future issues surface that require their expertise.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The company providing this service has been doing such things since time immemorial: they’re experts in handling change because every day brings something new into our lives.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Assessing Performance</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Application management using the best app for this purpose will help you measure storage, performance, and many other things.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">With hard numbers like these available in your organization’s system of record (the application), managers can ensure their applications perform as expected, whether it be meeting goals or seeking improvements- all through real-time data collection from within its own framework!</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Keep Tracking</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The final step of the application support and maintenance services process can be a difficult one, as bugs cause issues for your product. Bugs that are not fixed will give developers headaches and affect their work daily with time-consuming app monitoring tasks.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This leads many companies to outsource these applications in order to save money from having multiple employees focus on just parts or all aspects related to it instead of spreading yourselves too thinly across different areas outside engineering if you have enough manpower already at hand working solely towards fixing those problems!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This not only saves companies from financial penalties caused by poor maintenance but also enables the users to enjoy stable functioning of their applications through constant changes and new products developed day-in/day-out without interruption or downtime for customers who depend on these services in order to perform efficiently at work every single day.</p>

<h2><b>Why do Startups, SMEs, and Big Brands Focus On App Maintenance?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 5 reasons mentioned here will help you understand why application development and maintenance services both are crucial.   </span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Re-engineering For Extraordinary Performance</strong></h3>

Following the Re-engineering alternative, you can integrate new features and functionalities in the application, leading to enhanced scalability, security, and the efficiency of the application.      </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">App maintenance helps you automatically improve the bugs lingering in the old app edition. A periodic upgrade and re-engineering of the system enhances the app&#8217;s quality and minimizes system failure issues.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Constant Monitoring To Make Productive App Update </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technological environment is enriching and transforming each day. Moreover, the app system and environment also get regular additions and updates from the industry. So seeing all this, it is essential to monitor each day&#8217;s changes as this can only help make efficient changes and update the application.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses can also get improvement tweaks with proper mobile app maintenance services. All of it can result in getting:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robust environment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing better output</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More efficient and trustworthy approach</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple to use functionalities and features </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Focus On Application Level For Business Growth</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_6PeJDHN6JspVb3l" alt="Business Growth" width="800" height="419" /></p>
<p style="padding-left: 320px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Source: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Northeastern University</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of maintenance, upgrades, and intelligent support can influence the overall application working, so to evade this, focus on its level of progress. Working on weekly-based maintenance will help you enhance app working.                        </span></p>
<p>If the businesses spend more time on Software Maintenance, they can make a profit, raise productivity, and make the app popular worldwide. But to do this efficiently, you need to make great plans, and for this, you can avail of application maintenance and support services.

<h3><strong>4. Updating To Better The Functionalities</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the future requirements and trending technologies can help you do outstanding application up-gradation. Re-engineering applications can help you only do code restructuring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make app features unique and the best, ‌focus on updating; this all can be done competently by availing </span>application maintenance services India<span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet user&#8217;s requirements and increase customer engagement, it&#8217;s crucial to focus on the latest trends; this is why top brands like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are focusing on embracing Augmented Reality (AR), <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI), Virtual Reality, Predictive Analytics, etc. </span></p>
<h3><strong>5. User Adoption To Boost Market Reach</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of application support and maintenance services and up-gradation can make your app outdated; this may impact the app&#8217;s user adoption rate. Nowadays, users just prefer using the modernized version of the application and software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So to make your app more extraordinary, focus on adopting the concepts that users require today; this will profit in enhancing user experience and user adoption rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the business will not center on the App Maintenance part, the business cannot meet users&#8217; desires, ultimately resulting in a waning number of users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, from 2006 to 2010, Orkut&#8217;s name was quite popular. All users liked this social media platform, but it&#8217;s fame was sustainable for a precise time frame due to the absence of maintenance. So note if you need to maintain the app popularity level, focus on the app updation and maintenance part.</span></p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Wrapping It Up</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No legacy can go forever; it&#8217;s essential to know when to update or upgrade. If you want to make your business application popular like Amazon, focus on both application development and application maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, after going through the write-up, if you have made your intention to avail of</span> Application Maintenance services, <span style="font-weight: 400;">get in touch with the top-notch </span>Application Maintenance company in India (ValueCoders)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h3><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><b>ReactJS</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"> React is a JavaScript library that works together with HTML and CSS. It is an open-source and front-end development library that enables the usage of native-like UI components for web and mobile application development. It is a very effective library that is designed to make smooth user experiences with less time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">It is very effective and can be used as a base technology in both web and mobile application development. The main purpose of using React is to create amazing looking user interfaces for mobile and web that can cater to great performance. React is being used in MVC development architecture and handles the &#8220;View&#8221; of the application.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP vs WordPress is one of the best-debated topics in the modern web development world. Several new web technologies have brought many recent changes to this domain. But as we all know <strong>“Old is Gold”. </strong></span></p>



<p style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Yes, you are thinking right! </b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even having various new web ruler technologies, businesses are still relying on some old yet strong web technologies. Here, I am talking about two master web technologies, i.e. PHP and WordPress. </span></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People had discussed a lot about them. You can find many articles discussing <em>PHP pros and cons, advantages of PHP, </em></span><em><a href="https://hackernoon.com/php-or-nodejs-top-tips-to-pick-the-right-technology-for-your-project-0lh31bs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">PHP vs NodeJS</a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/ecommerce-cms/best-cms-tools-to-start-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">WordPress vs Joomla</a>, PHP vs WordPress war, etc<strong>.</strong></em> But this is not the answer to all your queries. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the best between PHP and WordPress would consume your time, money, and your manual efforts too. In this fast-paced world, you can save these things by considering a well-formed piece like this. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we will look at some pointers profoundly and develop the desired result of the war between “PHP and WordPress”. Let’s begin the discussion with a small brief on both web technologies. </span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>PHP &amp; its frameworks:</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s first understand “what a PHP framework is?”. You will surely need a good knowledge of coding for<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/web-application-development?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=phpwordpress-17331-s11&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> website development.</a> PHP itself is a web programming language that helps you in developing awesome websites, web applications, and other tools with ease. It is the language that empowers WordPress, so it&#8217;s more than adequate for building your website.</span></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">RELATED: <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/php-vs-node-js-which-is-better-for-backend-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">PHP VS. NODE.JS : WHICH IS BETTER FOR BACKEND DEVELOPMENT?</a></h4>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for a &#8220;PHP web framework&#8221;, you can think of this <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/how-to-choose-the-right-technology-stack-for-your-web-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">web development language</a> as a flexible template. You will often find that certain powerful functions are involved within a framework, based on the various philosophies and goals of the creator, although that is not a prerequisite.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP web development frameworks provide you with the necessary elements</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and act as the bare-bones foundation to build a website. But this is not a complete solution for a full-fledged website. You may require to </span>hire PHP developers<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to accomplish this task as they will use their web development skills. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This difference can help you in making a decision between PHP and WordPress. </span></p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><b><strong>Question: Which will offer a great user experience between PHP and WordPress?</strong></b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A user experience (UX) is an important concern for all website owners, especially those who develop sites in-house. The ease of use of the chosen platform will play an important role in its efficiency and the effectiveness of the final product.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/popular-php-frameworks-to-watch-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>PHP framework </strong></a>is basically designed for developers, dealing with a level-programming language low, the UI/UX is usually pretty basic for them. On the other hand, a CMS like WordPress serves as a low technical entry point for developing a website, attaining an attractive graphical user interface (GUI) is key. Hence, a CMS like WordPress will be ideal if you need clarity during development and use.</span></p>



<p class="has-text-color has-normal-font-size" style="color: #a33500;"><b>Answer: WordPress is the winner in the war of PHP vs WordPress. </b></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>2) High Security</b></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image" style="text-align: center;">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="400" class="wp-image-17350 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-19.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-19.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-19-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-19-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

</div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><b>Question: Which platform between WordPress and PHP will provide great security to apps?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security, being the primary concern of all website owners, represents a huge difference between PHP and the WordPress CMS. In case, it fails to secure your site properly, regardless of your goals, it can result in sensitive data leaks into the wrong hands.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, this could lead to all kinds of financial and legal issues. This makes choosing the best between a PHP or CMS framework more than a matter of preference as it will directly affect the success of your brand or business.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, a WordPress CMS could be considered more secure, as the inherent security can be built into the platform itself. However, a PHP framework is considered a lower-level solution in terms of security. Here, you can essentially add the security features you need into the basic functionality of your site.</span></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>3) Constant Upgrades</b></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="400" class="wp-image-17351 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-16.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-16.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-16-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-16-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>
</div>



<p class="has-normal-font-size"><b>Question: Which provides quick and constant upgrades in the war of WordPress vs PHP?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we know that the Internet is a constantly evolving technology. And, we are keen to get constant updates and bug fixes that keep the wheel spinning efficiently and also help website visitors stay safe.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will often find that a CMS like WordPress will receive near-perpetual updates to add new features, bug fixings, improve security, and work on the user feedback. For instance, WordPress maintains a roadmap that describes the platform&#8217;s main release history, which is very active.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, a PHP framework does not usually update as consistently as WordPress does. This is because of the responsibility for improving various functionalities and security features with the help of a developer who works directly with the language. However, this does not make it less stable in theory.</span></p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><b>Question: Which one between WordPress and PHP offers more flexibility and custom development options?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People often argue that flexibility is not always a primary concern, especially when you have a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve with the site you are developing. In those cases, choosing a niche-specific solution would be more suitable.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But consider many third-party services you can use, especially if you are running an e-commerce website. For instance, order processing, marketing platforms, and many other tools and features should be seamlessly integrated into your chosen site-building solution.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CMS generally offers many options, and this is particularly true when it comes to the WordPress platform. However, the adaptability for those with specific requirements is usually less than that provided by a PHP framework. As with security, a PHP framework offers a broader scope for what it can accomplish, a great thanks to its low-level architecture.</span></p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><b>Question: Which is more SEO friendly between WordPress and PHP?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO(Search engine optimization) plays an important role when you develop a website as it directly influences your site’s rank in the search result of Google. To rank better in Google, your website content should be refined and fresh, which affects the overall quality of your website. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, WordPress is preferred more over PHP because it comes with several built-in features and extensions that can improve your technical SEO. It includes SEO plugins, XML sitemaps, and permalinks.  </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are some other SEO concerns to be taken care of viz. Good keyword research, quality content and rank methodologies, etc. </span></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>Conclusion: </b></h3>



<p>So, there you have it- your take on the PHP vs WordPress debate. I think that both frameworks have their pros and cons, but ultimately I believe that PHP is the better option for web development projects. The main reasons are its high-security standards, flexible codebase, SEO friendliness and great user experience.</p>

<h2><strong>MEAN or MERN: Which One Is Popular?</strong></h2>
<p><figure id="attachment_17066" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17066" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-17066 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-3.jpg" alt="mean-mern-stack-comparison" width="700" height="400" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-3.jpg 700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-3-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17066" class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: reddit.com</span></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for Angular Vs React driveways the popularity of MEAN Vs MERN stacks, respectively. Angular has been a very famous development stack for a long time. However, React is now taking the position of Angular in recent years. But the first position is still not fixed as it changes as per the market demand and type of the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the 2018 HackerRank Developer skills report, in 2018, Angular was the most famous web framework as 30% of developers stated that they knew it. However, 26% of programmers stated that they knew React, and this placed React in the 2nd position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same report in 2019 found that 30% of programmers desired to learn the React development stack. The corresponding number for Angular drained to 20%, which means that React is earning more prevalence than Angular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The absence of backward compatibility between Angular 2 and Angular 1 adversely influenced the reputation of Angular. Additionally, </span><strong><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-web-frameworks-all-respondents2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">StackOverflow Developer Survey</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Results 2020” also supports the summing-up that React is winning the development stack popularity race; this means MERN is at a leading position in terms of popularity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It confirms that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">React is the most used web framework</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as 35.9% of developers prefer to develop using it. The analogous number for Angular is 25.1%, which places it in the 3rd position.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_17067" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17067" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-17067 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-2.jpg" alt="mean-mern-stacks-angular-reactjs" width="700" height="400" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-2.jpg 700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-design-2-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17067" class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: insights.stackoverflow.com</span></figcaption></figure></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, it proved that </span><b><i>in terms of popularity the MERN Vs MEAN war winner is MERN</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So, now let’s move further to analyze the final result of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MEAN Stack Vs MERN Stack </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I have already told you that; the chief variation between MEAN Stack and <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/top-mern-stack-development-services-company-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">MERN stack</a> is the usage of AngularJS and ReactJS, respectively. </span></p>
<p><strong>Now let&#8217;s view the positive and negative characteristics of MEAN and MERN stacks.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Security and Scalability</span></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Both MEAN and MERN stack offers top-level security, so in terms of security, you can go with any of them. But in terms of security, MERN wins the MEAN Vs MERN race as it is more scalable than MEAN.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MVC Support</span></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you are going to create an enterprise-level app like LinkedIn, you need to maintain a complete architecture. For this reason, you should prefer the MEAN stack over the MERN stack. Choosing this will help you get </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Model-View-Controller architecture</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> support. But if I talk about managing the code in a simple manner, then you can go with MEAN.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Advanced and Simple UI</span></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To get an </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">advanced and simple UI</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> for your application, go with MERN technology. This stack generates a frame and presents it on the screen in very little time, guaranteeing a constant user interaction.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)</span></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MERN stack enables you to build and enlarge a CRUD application from start to finish. The usage of React simply handles rapidly changing data and also offers an impressive user interface. MERN is an ideal framework for developing a single-page application or a mobile app.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Third-party Support</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Utilizing third-party libraries is another best factor to contemplate when working on developing enterprise-level applications. MEAN has Angular, which has built-in features to support HTTP calls and unite to the back-end. However, ReactJS has supplementary libraries to bring in the corresponding functionality. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MEAN takes care of 3rd party extensions in a plug-and-play manner, whereas MERN requires extra configurations to perform the same thing.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Learning Curve</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Express.js, MongoDB, and Node.js are very famous, and they have wonderful documentation. You won’t see any noticeable difference in the learning curve of MERN and MEAN. However, your learning curve will alter between Angular and React. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Angular is a framework that uses Typescript and templates. You may see a steeper learning curve with Angular, whereas the React framework doesn’t have much learning curve. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Therefore, no single framework can be an all-rounder. You have to examine the features and functionalities to get a better outcome and to meet the business goals. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know about <strong>COVID 19</strong> very-well now. This pandemic has shaken the entire industry and also badly impacted the <strong>worldwide economy</strong>. This virus is so dangerous that it has affected millions of people worldwide, and still, the outbreak of coronavirus is difficult to handle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I think we can manipulate the outbreak of COVID 19 with the help of <strong>machine learning.</strong> ML can play a vital role in understanding and <strong>addressing the COVID-19 crisis</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning (MI) is correlated with artificial intelligence (AI). It is a process of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It helps in identifying the patterns and making the correct decision.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Why is Machine Learning Important for the Current Situation?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is one of the crucial elements of the business. <strong>Data-oriented decisions</strong> resolve the issue, and it also helps businesses in achieving goals at the right time. So, if you will use Machine Learning during the current situation, then it will help in identifying the risk, Diagnosing patients, and even can help in developing the COVID 19 effective drug in a faster way.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Screening and Diagnosing Patients</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When this new pandemic disease came into existence, it was hard to examine, screen, and diagnose the patients. Arranging testing facilities for the &#8220;n&#8221; number of people is a difficult task. But when it comes to employing ML to help diagnose COVID-19, promising research included the following areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Screening through face scan:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In a hospital in Florida, there was one first ML equipment that responded to COVID-19. On entering the hospital, patients are proffered with an automatic face scan, which utilizes ML to recognize whether a person has a fever or not. Now, this equipment is mostly used all over the world. This also helps in extracting data.</span></li>
<li><b>Using wearable technology:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ML is used in wearable technology to track the heart rate of the patient. Similarly, OURA&#8217;s research uses the tracking ring equipment that examines the sleep activity, body temperature, heart rate, and breathing rate to identify the pattern and recovery rate for COVID-19.&#8221;</span></li>
<li><b>Utilizing chatbot for screening:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Doctors do not have enough time to answer all questions of the patients, and that&#8217;s why nowadays, various countries are using a chatbot to save the patient&#8217;s response. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the famous examples of COVID 19 screening chatbot is the Aarogya Setu app. This application asks a few questions; after that, it records user response, and according to that, it deals with the situation. If in case the app records the response that is in favor of COVID 19 symptoms, then it allows you to contact the doctor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also make the modern ML apps that can help you to analyze the pattern of COVID 19. ML is a great technique that can be applied in an app, equipment, or other things.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Developing Drugs Faster</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not simple to develop the drug faster as it includes quality check, trial, testing, and various other phases. But among all drug development phases, you can cut down a few development stages with the help of ML, which will help in developing the drug in a faster way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ML can speed up the drug development process. When researchers were finding small molecule inhibitors of the Ebola virus, then they used Bayesian ML models that helped in recording the pattern of the virus. This finally accelerated the process by shorting down the testing phase. Means in COVID 19 drug development; testing phase time can be decreased by making use of Machine Learning. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Finding Existing Drugs to Cure COVID-19</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After developing the drug companies spend a lot of time and money in approving the new drug. Well, this makes sure that medicine that came into the market is safe and secure for patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process protects us, but on considering COVID- 19 situations; this process looks like a waste of time, and during this time, we need a faster process to make things stable. Repurpose drugs are one of the best alternatives to save time.</span></p>
<p><strong>In this case, ML can help us up too much extent, and this will include the following things:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Building knowledge graphs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can utilize natural language processing in which ML is applied to read and understand a large number of scientific articles; this will help in creating the biomedical knowledge graphs.</span></li>
<li><b>Predicting Interactions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">ML is already used by the researchers to predict the interaction between drugs and viral proteins. This process is difficult, but it can be made simple by using ML.</span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Role of Machine Learning In Brawling With Other Viral Pandemic diseases</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the doctor makes a record of handling the simpler case in a month or year, then other viral pandemics can be controlled fastly. It is hard for doctors to do so as they already have a lot of things to do. But this thing can be examined by using Machine Learning apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s take an example; Influenza A affected a large population as it also has the potential to jump to human hosts. The researchers who were working on Influenza A isolated 67,940 protein sequences from a database. After isolating the sequences, they filtered the protein, and then, at last, they found 11 influenza proteins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of ML, researchers identified the proteins that have a tendency of jumping to human hosts. And once after analyzing these viral proteins, they focused on developing the drug that fights against those proteins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way, ML made the researcher task easier. Similarly, machine learning apps can also record, examine, and predict other viral pandemics. But for doing so, you need to develop leading Making learning apps.</span></p>

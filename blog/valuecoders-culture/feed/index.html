										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vinove Software &amp; Services Pvt. Ltd. held its monthly session of &#8220;Chai Pe Charcha&#8221; on March 10, 2023, where the Business Development team discussed their ongoing projects, recent achievements, and strategies for future growth. This monthly meetup serves as a platform for team members to share their views, connect with each other, and work towards a common goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The collaborative and supportive environment created by &#8220;Chai Pe Charcha&#8221; fosters a sense of community and shared purpose among team members, boosting their morale, motivation, and productivity. During the session, the team members shared their success stories with Client onboarding, which included Dubai Police, Van Hamburg Invest B.V, Roland Berger Holding GmbH, and others.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29847 size-full" title="salesteam 2" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/salesteam-2.jpg" alt="salesteam 2" width="384" height="512" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/salesteam-2.jpg 384w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/salesteam-2-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The team also discussed their recent accomplishment of opening a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/valuecoder-new-office-in-dubai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">new branch office in Dubai</a> and explored new business opportunities and emerging market trends. They exchanged their ideas on improving customer engagement, retention, and optimizing the sales funnel to <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/a-master-plan-to-boost-website-performance-engagement-conversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">improve conversion rates</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mr. Ankur, VP- Business Development appreciated the sales team during the session, saying that this is the best sales team they have ever had, and he hopes they will do even better in the coming months. As the discussion progressed, team members continued to offer constructive feedback and advice to one another, exploring approaches and strategies for addressing common challenges.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-29848 size-full" title="salesteam" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/salesteam.jpg" alt="salesteam" width="288" height="512" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/salesteam.jpg 288w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/salesteam-169x300.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chai Pe Charcha sessions provide team members with a casual environment to engage in conversations outside of their typical work environment, break down barriers, and foster a sense of camaraderie. By encouraging open and honest communication, team members can feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas, leading to improved collaboration and creativity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These sessions can also reduce stress and improve morale, leading to a more joyful and <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/valuecoders-big-achievement-of-the-great-title-great-place-to-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">enjoyable work environment</a>. In conclusion, Chai Pe Charcha sessions are an effective way to encourage collaboration and nurture a positive team dynamic, providing a platform for informal discussions where team members can gain valuable insights and develop stronger relationships, leading to improved growth and success.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">Since its inception in 2004, ValueCoders has been providing IT outsourcing services worldwide. We combine business domain knowledge, proven methodologies, and the technical expertise of 450+ skilled software professionals to yield high-quality solutions that add value to businesses.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">We proudly announce that Vinove has been awarded another prestige certification — ISO 9001:2015 and CMMi Level 3 for its services and development. We are commanded by these governing bodies and will continue delivering best-in-class services.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">What Is ISO 9001:2015</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">ISO’s Quality Management Systems-Requirements (QMS) series of standards is a suite of certifications that cover vital topics such as quality management, supplier management, product realization, and service provision. ISO 9001:2015 provides businesses with requirements for designing, implementing, and maintaining a quality management system to ensure customer satisfaction by meeting customer needs regarding features and time requirements.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The specification requires processes to be continually evaluated, enhanced, or revised to meet the company’s changing business needs. In addition, it can help the company build and maintain a culture of continual improvement, leading to sustainable performance improvements for all products or services offered. The standard also includes provisions on records management, corrective action procedures, and configuration control.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">The Benefits of Implementing ISO 9001:2015</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">The benefits of implementing this standard are many, as they provide a way to measure the quality &amp; performance of your organization. If you’re looking for ways to improve your business, ISO 9001:2015 is a great place to start, as it offers -Improvement in quality &amp; efficiency -better customer satisfaction -improved safety, and environmental protection. It’s important to remember that not all businesses need ISO. However, when you decide to apply, there are many benefits:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">An ISO certification provides proof of competence at every level of your operation. With this assurance, employees can focus on doing what they do best.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Increases customer satisfaction by providing a system of guarantees on quality.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It helps improve all aspects of your business, from efficiency to communication.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Once you implement your quality management system, you’ll have a way to measure success.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It allows your business to work with other companies that have certified their organizations (making them easier partners).</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">About Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Capability Maturity Model Integration, or CMMI, is a framework for improving software development organizations’ processes and product quality. The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute developed CMMI. The model’s five maturity levels increase organizational capability and rigor. Here are the five maturity levels:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">1. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Initial</strong> — New businesses go through an unpredictable environment that leads to increased risks and inefficiency at this stage.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">2. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Managed</strong>&#8211; At this level, companies have formalized their software engineering practices with documented policies &amp; procedures.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">3. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Defined</strong> — These companies have documented plans for improvement at this stage.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">4. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Quantitatively Managed</strong> — Companies have measurement systems that quantify how well they’re meeting performance targets in the project management’s six dimensions (quality attributes) in process areas.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">5. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Optimizing</strong> — Companies must establish metrics and quantitative goals for each maturity level before progressing to the next one. You may outsource some aspects of your software development process at this stage if you don’t have the staff available internally.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The final stage occurs when an organization has achieved all other stages, has established its own metrics system from within, and can reliably assess its progress in improving productivity, efficiency and effectiveness over time through iterative activities.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Benefits of CMMI in Software Development</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a complete process improvement model for developing, maintaining, and acquiring software systems. It is built upon eight capability areas:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Planning, organizing, staffing, directing &amp; controlling the work</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Analysis &amp; design</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Implementation and testing</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Operation &amp; maintenance</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Evaluation of results</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Problem detection</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Diagnosis</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Correction</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">CMMI provides a structured set of processes that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of any organization. CMMI is an invaluable asset to any organization that seeks to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance performance.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One way to ensure the success of CMMI is by training employees on how it works so they can take ownership of its implementation. If you are looking for a trustworthy <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-software-developers-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software development company</a>,</strong> look no further than us! Our experts will help you implement this methodology into your business.</p>

<hr />
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">The Need For Integrating Systems</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">CMMI is a voluntary standard, which means organizations can choose to use it or not. But most large companies have adopted CMMI in some form. If you’re looking for work as a software engineer, your next employer will likely either be using CMMI or be interested in learning more about it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Overall, the benefits of ISO 9001:2015 are overwhelmingly positive. It will help your business grow by providing a formalized system for quality control and improvement. Implementing this international standard can not only improve your business’s processes, but it can also make you more competitive in your industry.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the whole globe. During this pandemic, most of the enterprises(small to big) adopted remote working for employees and clients&#8217; safety. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the initial days when the lockdown was announced, many companies have faced various sorts of issues while managing to work from home (WFH). Even still few of the organizations are facing the same problems at the stretch of remote team management.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Challenges to Manage a Remote Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A remote team is a group of experts from different time zones, distinct skills, and different cultures working unitedly on a unified project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, all small, moderate, big enterprises are focusing on adopting remote working as this is beneficial for current and upcoming time. </span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the survey, it has been found that <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>82%</strong> of </span>respondents said that they experience less stress.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Harvard Business Review</a></strong>, <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>87%</strong></span> of respondents feel more connected via remote working.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the team works from the office, then it requires less management effort as a comparison to remote working. While managing the remote team, many challenges come across, and some of the <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/5-strategies-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">remote team management </a></strong>challenges are related to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the Top Communication Tool</li>
<li>Hiring the Correct Resources</li>
<li>Lacking Accountability Program</li>
<li>Noticing Everyone&#8217;s Time</li>
<li>Unclear Roles and Tasks</li>
<li>Lack of Schedule</li>
<li>Unmanageable Employee Tracking</li>
<li>Lack of Conversation within the Team</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Is The Biggest Advantage of Remote Working?</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1111309/biggest-benefits-to-working-remotely-worldwide/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Statista </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated that in 2020, 32% of respondents said that flexibility is one of the most significant benefits of remote working. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility not only helps employees, but it also benefits the organizations now you might be thinking how?</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, when the employees are given work flexibility, then they try to complete and deliver the task on time, and this finally increases business productivity.</span></p>

<h2><strong>7 Significant and Efficient Ways To Manage Remote Team</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at some point, working virtually is useful then similarly, it also has few drawbacks like it requires perfect remote team management.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the employee of the company will be productive, then only you will be able to boost the business growth, but for that, it is indispensable to manage the <strong><a href="https://www.workstatus.io/blog/workforce-management/remote-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">remote working</a></strong> properly. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should do a proper module to manage the remote team and work. I have mentioned a few ways that will help you to manage the remote team. </span></p>
<ol style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><strong>Make Use Of Modern Technologies</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Proper Checkment On Punch In and Punch-Out</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Don&#8217;t Let Communication Gap Hamper your Productivity</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Make Sure that Your Team Is Satisfied</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus On Final Result Not on Activity</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arrange Proper Resources</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Offer Flexibility</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Proper Record On Punch In and Punch-Out</strong><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13767 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2.jpg" alt="Punch in &amp; Punch out" width="500" height="300" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2.jpg 500w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you are managing the remote team, then suggest them to make proper punch in and punch out. If you are a team leader, then you should daily check the employees punch in and punch out. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing that does not end here means if in case the employee forgets to make a punch in and punch out then as a leader you should once ask the employee why he/she doesn&#8217;t mark the check-in or check out.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the new member has joined the team, then the management team should accurately provide them guidance related to check-in and check out. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Don’t Bring Communication Gap &#8211; Stay Connected</strong></h3>
<p><b></b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13768 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3.png" alt="dedicated teams" width="512" height="318" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arranging formal or informal meetings with the team will help you all to get connected. While working remotely, there are so many issues that are faced by the employees, try to fix those issues &amp; queries on video or voice call.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, voice and video call facilities are available mostly on all apps like Skype, Zoom so for arranging the meeting you can use such apps. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling is the best way to interact with the team, and this also helps the team to connect with the leaders directly. So pic your phone or video call rather than emailing.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to communicate on the video call; this will help you in recognizing employee expression, and to know whether the employee and clients are interested in the talk or not.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Make Sure that Your Team Is Satisfied</strong></h3>
<p>Being out of sight, you may address problems in knowing the needs of every employee. But try to understand the same by recognizing the clues given by the employees.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get an effective outcome from the team, leaders should try to fulfill the requirements of the team. If the employee is satisfied, then he/she will only be able to provide an effective result. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase the workflow as a team leader, you should know from which situation the employee is going through.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an employee is encountering any sort of issues that can be resolved from your side, then try to fix the same. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In remote working, employees face various problems like internet issues, lack of communication, etc this can be resolved by providing great IT support, and as a result, you get exceptional remote team management.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Focus On Final Result Not on Activity</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the team is working remotely then focus on the employee&#8217;s work, which means you need to check whether the employee&#8217;s work is productive or not! whether he/she is submitting tasks on time or not! Try not to focus on the activity of the remote employees; it is not possible to trace or track all work activity.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think if employees are completing their tasks on time and offering you valuable work, then its activity hardly matters for the organization. You can also encourage the team members; this will boost team performance.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Arrange Proper Resources</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All employees that work in the organization don&#8217;t have proper working setup (laptop, internet connectivity) back at home. So, as a team leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to arrange the assets for the employees. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the COVID-19 pandemic, many employees faced and even facing issues related to working stations, laptops, active internet, etc. If in case your team members are also confronting the same problem then you should adequately guide him/her to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also connect your team members with the IT team to resolve the technical glitches; this will save your time and will also fix the employee concerning issues faster. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a new member has joined the team then as a team leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to make sure that whether the software and other necessary tools have been correctly installed on the employee work station or not.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Offer Flexibility</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13769 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4.png" alt="Remote Team Management" width="460" height="300" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4.png 460w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your team is working remotely, then the company should offer flexibility to the employees, this magnifies the employees work performance and also helps them to deliver the task on time. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are offering flexibility to the employees then as a team leader, you should observe employees&#8217; total working hours.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major drawback of work from home (WFH) is that along with working remotely, you need to manage other tasks also and that this somewhere affects the employee work who are not given the flexibility.</span></p>

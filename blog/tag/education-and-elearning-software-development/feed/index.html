<p class="graf graf--p">You must be wondering that what the cost of e-Learning mobile app development or software development is in these countries. Following is the hourly price chart that gives some notion into the cost of development depending on the complexity of the project.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">India : $25- $50/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Ukraine: $19-$60/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Russia: $20-$35/hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Poland : $20-$75/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Romania : $15-$25/hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Bulgaria : $20-$50/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">China : $19-$39/Hour</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Israel : $31-$75/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Singapore : $25-$60/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">From above, it would be clear that you can find countries with diverse skill sets and different developer prices. Meantime, you have to look for other aspects such as the communication skill and knowledge of your field.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>Some Frequently Asked Questions That You Must Look</strong></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong>What are Offshore Developer Rates by Country?</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The average hourly rate of a software engineer is $35-$45, while developers from Latin American countries like Brazil or Mexico typically ask for about 30 hours. Indian engineers demand rates between 20–30 dollars per hour on projects involving implementing new features to existing systems.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A lot can be learned when researching how much each country pays its developers; the Ukraine market has been reported as being rather inexpensive at around 25 USD, but other regions such as Poland may have higher salaries averaging close to 65 EURO (or 6000 Zlotych) Per Day! Developers working in Romania usually get paid according to an Hourly Rate.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How Much Is Indian Developers’ Hourly Price?</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">According to eLearning Mind, Indian software developers are some of the cheapest in the world.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education is a broad term, and when it comes to mobile app development, there is a diverse range of software companies that offer various educational apps. We are living in a digital world, where many children are growing up with apps and digital media as a part of their life.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distance education, underpinned by mobile access, has increased, and it is bringing unprecedented competition to traditional models of schooling. We can say educational app development technologies have enhanced students&#8217; learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The injunction for mobile education is so high that experts anticipate the market to expand by </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200203005327/en/Global-Education-Apps-Market-2020-2024-Growing-Focus-on-Wearable-Technology-to-Boost-Market-Growth-Technavio" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$46.9 billion with a CAGR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of about 26% by 2024.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-24226 size-full" title="education" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/education.jpg" alt="educational app development services, hire educational app developers, education app development company" width="512" height="384" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/education.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/education-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to incorporate educational application development trends in your business applications, it becomes important to know about the latest trends in this area. </span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So let’s move further and know the 8+ Educational Mobile App trends…</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">8+ Top E-Learning Mobile Application Development Trends</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Here view the list of best Educational app development trends for 2024. In fact, there are many <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-mobile-app-development-companies-that-innovate-unique-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">mobile app development companies</a> that are focusing on developing mobile applications for the education sector.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, it is true that a mobile educational application can provide a large number of benefits to both students and teachers.</p>

<h3>Gamification</h3>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZABTr4WKmbT8ANY3" alt="" width="500" height="350" data-image-id="0*ZABTr4WKmbT8ANY3" data-width="500" data-height="350" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="padding-left: 320px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Image Source: Moveu</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Consider adding some gamification elements, which are becoming more popular among educators. This includes badges and points, leaderboards, and puzzle-style activities.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Including some games, mechanics can increase student engagement. Another benefit of gamification is it allows you to quickly iterate on your content and make changes based on data gathered from users as they interact with your app.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If your app involves capturing data, such as in a quiz or test environment, gamification could be a great way for students to continue interacting with your content even after class is over.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you’re just looking for some quick inspiration, check out some of these gamification examples:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Quizlet offers point-based challenges that build on each other, making it easy for students to progress through a series of challenges.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Brainly uses badges as an alternative to points and leaderboards as another way to increase engagement.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">For puzzle-style activities, Kahoot is a great option that keeps students engaged by turning their learning into a game format.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Another great app for education is ScienceSpot, which helps teach science in a fun environment with multiple games based on different scientific principles. Students can even add their own science-related questions and answers if they aren’t satisfied with what is currently available.</li>

<h3>Video Content</h3>

<p class="graf graf--p" style="padding-left: 280px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Image Source: ViewSonic</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">As opposed to having a text-heavy page, video content gives your website visitors something more engaging and interesting to focus on. In fact, visual information has been shown to be processed <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://oit.williams.edu/files/2010/02/using-images-effectively.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-href="https://oit.williams.edu/files/2010/02/using-images-effectively.pdf" data-wpel-link="external">60,000 times</a> faster in human brains than written information.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">And guess what? More than 82% of traffic online is video traffic (what’s new in publishing). By getting some video content onto your site, you’ll give yourself an edge when you want people to engage with your brand.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Video content in educational applications can include instructional videos, demonstrations, or tutorials that are embedded into a lesson plan. It’s also crucial to note that video content isn’t just for websites anymore — it can also be used for mobile apps as well!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Khan Academy proffers 1000+ free instructional videos for students to learn from at their own pace. These videos are available on both desktop and mobile devices, making it easy for students to learn on the go.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">In a similar vein, Duolingo offers an app that is geared towards learning a new language through fun and engaging methods — all while tracking your progress along the way!</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">This app is also available on both desktop and mobile devices, allowing you to seamlessly transition between platforms as you work towards mastering a new language.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">TeacherPayTeachers allows teachers to create and sell lesson plans online (in the form of video), which can be accessed by other teachers who are looking for supplemental material in their classrooms or homeschoolers.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">

<p class="graf graf--p">Gone are the days of 30-minute lectures on outdated topics. Thanks to rapid technological advancements, we’re able to fit a lifetime of education into our pockets with mobile apps known as microlearning.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The bite-sized lessons help you learn on your schedule without ever leaving your smartphone behind. If you want something more engaging than flashcards, mobile educational apps might be just what you need.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are so many popular educational applications that focus on microlearning educational mobile app trends, like:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Coursera</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Udemy</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Khan Academy</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the example below: How Microlearning Works? Examples of Microlearning in Education App:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The development companies have implemented different methods for delivering content in their products. Some use slideshows, others video or interactive elements.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The example from Coursera is presented in the form of live coding (applications source code is written in real-time).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One of the most recent trends is to show code execution within an emulator for each language being taught (in most cases, it’s JavaScript). Students can run code within an emulator, which runs on the mobile device itself, instead of downloading the entire software development kit for each new language being learned.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Live coding gives the ability to students who already know programming basics but want to learn new languages at their own pace &amp; not lose knowledge acquired before.</p>

<h3>Collaborative Learning</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*k4ewfDSXq-o3Ldm2" alt="" width="800" height="456" data-image-id="0*k4ewfDSXq-o3Ldm2" data-width="820" data-height="468" /></figure>

<p class="graf graf--p">Does your app have a social component? The growing popularity of learning platforms like Edmodo and Pear Deck shows that many students (and teachers) love learning from peers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you’re creating an educational app, include a way for users to interact with one another in some capacity — ideally, a platform that promotes collaborative sharing, feedback, and problem-solving.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Students will take great ownership over their own learning if they feel like they can collaborate with other users when solving problems or asking questions.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Think about how you can incorporate social functionality into your educational mobile app development process — including discussions, commenting systems, and interactions like #hashtags.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, think about how you can make it easy for teachers to access student work and respond accordingly. With so much potential value being created by students, it’s important to give them tools that help them showcase their work.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A teacher should be able to easily view all student submissions within an app at once and provide comments back on those submissions via simple thumbs up/down buttons. This type of comment system provides quick peer review while still allowing teachers flexibility in providing feedback.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--p">Few famous education apps use collaborative leading as it is one of the majorly used Educational Mobile App trends:</h4>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Canvas allows educators to assign homework directly through their online interface, which is then automatically sent out as a push notification to each student’s device.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Once students open up Canvas on their phones, they are presented with individual assignments along with comments from fellow classmates who may have already completed the assignment.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Google Classroom has a built-in discussion board where students can post questions for others to answer. These discussion boards also allow teachers to monitor conversations and jump in when necessary.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR) integration</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oZeLz5hEeyquRkgC" alt="" width="800" height="350" data-image-id="0*oZeLz5hEeyquRkgC" data-width="1600" data-height="700" /></figure>

<p class="graf graf--p">VR and AR integration is one of the best Educational <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/mobile-app-development-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Mobile App trends</a> that will only continue to grow. The technology has been used for years but has recently begun making its way into classrooms.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Google’s Expeditions Pioneer Program allows students to take virtual field trips around the world with their classmates without leaving their classroom.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It’s also being used by companies like Boeing, which uses VR technology for employee training. While it’s still too early to know what exactly these trends will mean for education, it’s clear that they have the potential to change how we learn and teach forever.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">In addition to VR/AR integration, mobile apps are becoming more personalized than ever before. This includes customized learning plans based on students’ strengths and weaknesses as well as apps that use artificial intelligence (AI) to adapt to each student’s learning style.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">As AI continues to improve over time, it could provide teachers with an invaluable tool for delivering individualized instruction at scale.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Nearly all major education apps incorporate some sort of machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) technology. For example,</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Chegg, a company that provides textbook rentals and homework help, uses AI to create personalized study schedules for students based on their academic history.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Similarly, ClassDojo is an app that allows teachers and parents to monitor student behavior in real-time by using a smartphone camera.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">The app analyzes each photo and detects how many students are paying attention or whether they’re engaged in inappropriate behavior. It then sends teachers instant alerts so they can intervene if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">As machine learning becomes more prevalent in mobile applications, it will likely have a significant impact on everything from test prep to virtual reality (VR) training.</p>

<h3><strong>Flipped Classroom Approach</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ClmKQk5vvnmDJV3i" alt="" width="800" height="395" data-image-id="0*ClmKQk5vvnmDJV3i" data-width="1456" data-height="720" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="padding-left: 280px; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Image Source: PNG Image</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">With a flipped-classroom approach, students watch video lectures outside of class on their own time and in their own space. Teachers use class time for activities such as small group discussions or problem-solving exercises.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In an effort to make learning more dynamic and foster critical thinking skills, educators have begun turning toward flipped classrooms.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">And because videos can be made at any time and taught by anyone, they’re making it more manageable for teachers to integrate technology into their curriculum — which is particularly important as schools continue wrestling with budget constraints.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">A study published by Harvard found that instructors in three schools who adopted elements of an ‘engaged learning’ curriculum saw significant improvements among their middle school students.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">In another study from UCLA, researchers discovered that increased use of online content increased academic performance among first-year college students taking science courses.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Flipped learning doesn’t have to be limited to just math and science either; schools across America are beginning to flip English classes as well.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">As mobile devices and applications become more popular, so does social learning. Social learning is the process of creating, sharing, using, and adapting new knowledge within a community of practice.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Educators have seen benefits in using social learning — some claim it increases student engagement and creates more personal connections between teachers and students.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you are trying to create an educational mobile app, keep social learning in mind while designing — it could help your app rise above all others.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are so many examples of education apps using social learning:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">StudyBlue</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Coursera</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Blackboard Learn</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Khan Academy and</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Duolingo</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">These apps use features like peer-to-peer communication, discussion boards, or collaborative projects to allow users to learn from each other. Some even have built-in tools that allow users to contribute their own content or answer questions posed by other users.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In addition to offering support for social learning, these types of apps can also be integrated with other platforms like Twitter or Facebook for additional user interaction opportunities.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The educational industry provides a tremendous opportunity to technology startups, so businesses should do thorough research before developing a quality educational application that fulfills the needs of the market.</p>

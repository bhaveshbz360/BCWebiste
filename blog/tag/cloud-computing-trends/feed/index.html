<h3><strong>Cloud Security </strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-damage-costs-10-trillion-by-2025/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expects global cybercrime costs to grow by 15 percent per year over the next five years, reaching $10.5 trillion USD annually by 2025, up from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 trillion USD in 2015</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, when </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/511283/worldwide-survey-cloud-computing-risks/#:~:text=As%20of%202022%2C%20surveyed%20technical,to%20be%20a%20significant%20challenge." rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveyed about cloud technologies, technical executives, managers, and practitioners worldwide reported that security was the primary difficulty they faced in using these technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">85% of respondents felt that security was significant. Common reported difficulties include cloud spending management, inadequate governance, and insufficient resources/experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spreading workloads across various providers creates an extra challenge when faced with managing risk at heart because no single provider has all your information on its system, which poses another problem: who will monitor what if something goes wrong?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution lies not just in better cybersecurity practices but also in ensuring a reliable service from vendor A before asking them about B’s capabilities or choosing differently next time around – whatever comes first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing response to these concerns has been the acquisition of cloud security access brokers (CASBs). CASB’s are software that operates between your organization and platforms for securely accessing data, using measures like centralizing governance with an ironclad grip on all aspects of protection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a post by </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news/valuates-reports/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the global size of the Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB) market in 2019 was USD 8941.1 million and is predicted to reach USD 36910 Million by the end of 2026, with a CAGR of 22.2 % in 2021-26</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS cloud has been appreciated for its security provisions. You can connect with an AWS cloud consulting company with the required expertise if you want to leverage its potential for your enterprise.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Hybrid Cloud </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a multi-cloud approach, businesses can take advantage of the differing allowances in both public and private clouds. Hybrid strategies are focused on using both types of infrastructure for targeted benefits that align with its users’ needs – increased scalability while still maintaining higher cost efficiency than if they were solely relying on just one type.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A well-designed hybrid system gives businesses more flexibility when scaling up or down depending upon what’s needed; it also has features like faster reaction speeds thanks to being able to draw power from both sources simultaneously without sacrificing security concerns about where data resides (private vs. public).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1232355/hybrid-cloud-market-size/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, In 2021, the global hybrid cloud market was valued at 85 billion U.S. dollars and is expected to reach 262 billion U.S. dollars in 2027. Over this period, the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow at the highest rate. Some key players in this market are Cisco, HPE, AWS, and IBM</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cloud has the potential to change how we think about data storage in a world where security, optimization, and interpretative services require interoperability with different locations type or sources for information-in other words, “a string that connects separated pieces”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It becomes easier than ever to store your largest assets offsite in an easily accessible format from anywhere at any time without fear they’ll be compromised by hackers downtown who might want access to only one aspect (or even just part)of what you’re working on now think. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2022, 90 percent of organizations will use information as a critical organizational asset. To gain access and security to data across cloud providers, an organization needs centralized frameworks like data fabrics which employ APIs for seamless cross-cloud collaboration on consolidated insights into operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reduces vendor lock-in by providing unified service options from one provider; allowing enterprises can leverage them all within their infrastructure rather than duplicating efforts elsewhere, such as with less advanced cloud solutions that may not meet current business demands or offer sufficient features compared with those offered today – also known as “vendor Sovleware.”</span></p>
<h3><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence has seen massive growth in the past few years, and combination with other modern technologies, such as Cloud, it gives countless opportunities to industries.</span></p>

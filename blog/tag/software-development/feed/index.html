										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Due to changing work and market culture, custom software development has become a trend among businesses. Earlier custom software was a significant part of enterprise processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">However, custom applications are also helping companies engage with their customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Thus, we must develop a user-friendly and futuristic business application that fulfills the expectations of our target audience with greater convenience and swiftness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">If you are striving to lure your target customer using an excellent tool, you know the significance of exclusive custom software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><b>App development firms you are partnering with must have </b></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Expertise in modern technologies </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Relevant experience  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Consolidate data security provisions </span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">A team of deft developers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">However, hiring a custom software development company that can infuse modern tech to create a nerve-wracking tool requires sharp eyes. Mounting on the journey to find the right <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">custom software development company</a></strong>, you will find that several firms brag about their expertise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">However, not everyone can suit your needs and complete desirable software development. </span></p>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Software Product Development: An Overview</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services?utm_source=Organic+-+ValueCoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software Product Development</a> is designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software products. It includes the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-engineering-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software engineering process</a> of developing software programs and the business aspects of managing software projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, it is a complex process that involves many stages, from initial conception to final delivery. The development process must consider the software product&#8217;s various elements, including its functionality, usability, performance, and security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the software product must be compatible with the hardware it will run on and meet all applicable standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It typically begins with a requirements-gathering phase, in which the end user&#8217;s needs are identified. Once the requirements are understood, the software engineers can begin designing the software. The software is then coded or programmed and undergoes extensive testing before it is finally released to the end user. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After we release the software product, the software development team may continue to work on it, adding new features or fixing any discovered bugs. Software products are often updated regularly, even after they have been released to the public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software product development might be challenging but can be advantageous. A well-designed and well-executed software product can make a difference in people&#8217;s lives. It can help them be more productive, efficient, and organized. A software product can improve communication and collaboration among team members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When done right, software product development can be a rewarding experience for all involved.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Types of Software Development Processes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software product development can be broadly classified into two main categories: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agile Software Development</strong></li>
<li><strong>Waterfall Software Development</strong></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_27753" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27753" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-27753" title="Types of Software Development Processes" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Types-of-Software-Development-Processes.jpg" alt="Types of Software Development Processes" width="800" height="818" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Types-of-Software-Development-Processes.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Types-of-Software-Development-Processes-293x300.jpg 293w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Types-of-Software-Development-Processes-768x785.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-27753" class="wp-caption-text">Types of Software Development Processes</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, so choosing the right one for your project is important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Agile Software Development</strong> is an iterative and incremental approach to software product development. It focuses on delivering software in short cycles, known as sprints, and frequently evolving the software based on customer feedback. This flexibility makes agile software development well-suited for projects with rapidly changing requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Waterfall Software Development</strong> is a more traditional approach that takes a linear and sequential approach to software product development. Each project phase must be completed in this approach before moving on to the next phase. It can make waterfall software development more predictable and easier to manage but less flexible when compared to agile software development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which approach is right for your project will depend on several factors, including the nature of the project, the team&#8217;s experience, and the customer&#8217;s preferences. Ultimately, the best approach is the one that will help you deliver a high-quality software product on time and within budget.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Why Do Businesses Require Software Product Development?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A well-designed software product can give you an edge over competitors in today&#8217;s competitive market. A custom software solution can help you better serve your customers and meet their needs more effectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since your business is unique, software product development can help you capitalize on your distinguishing qualities and give you a competitive edge. By streamlining processes and automating tasks, software product development can save your business time and money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software development process involves creating custom software solutions specific to your business&#8217;s needs. This process can help you overcome many common business challenges, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inefficiencies caused by using off-the-shelf software that doesn&#8217;t meet all of your needs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lack of scalability or flexibility as your business grows</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of customer engagement due to a poor user experience</span></li>

<h2><strong>There are many benefits to pursuing Software Product Development for your Business:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows you to get what you need from your software solution. There&#8217;s no more trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole &#8211; with custom software; you can have a solution designed specifically for your business.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software product development can save you time and money in the long run. When you have a software solution tailored to your specific needs, you are less likely to encounter problems down the road. This can save you both time and money in troubleshooting and maintenance.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software product development allows you to have a competitive edge. With a custom software solution that meets your unique business needs, you can give yourself a leg up on the competition.</span></li>

<h2><strong>When Your Business Needs Software Product Development?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how small or large your business may be, you should be prepared to adapt to the needs of your customers, both current and future. To do that, you need to stay on top of the market, keep an eye on the competition, and react accordingly by creating new products and services that fill existing gaps in the market or provide a competitive advantage over other businesses in your industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way is through software product development – creating custom-made software solutions that meet your customers&#8217; needs. But how can you know when to bring in outside help and outsource this process? Learn here:</span></p>
<h3><strong>When There Is A Need For Automation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a fact: the more you automate, your business becomes more efficient. That&#8217;s because computers can process information much faster than humans, which saves time and money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s global economy, where companies compete for 24/7 on every continent, it just makes sense to automate as many tasks as possible to maximize production without sacrificing quality or efficiency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company could benefit from a software product development lifecycle, it might be time for an upgrade!</span></p>
<h3><strong>If The Current Software Cannot Be Customized To Meet The Business&#8217;s Specific Needs</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software development can be expensive, so it&#8217;s important to know when your business is ready. Before you invest in a software developer, ask yourself if the current software cannot be customized to meet the business&#8217;s specific needs. If this applies, then you may need a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=Organic+-+ValueCoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software Development Company</a>. You will want to find one with experience with your industry and business type. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a consulting firm could not provide the same services as a retail chain. Make sure you are up-to-date on new technological trends before engaging in contracts with developers. Some of these trends include SaaS (software as a service) providers like Salesforce or Box, platforms such as Magento or Shopify, and technologies such as HTML5 and mobile applications.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When Your Company Experiences Low Efficiency &amp; Miscommunication-related Issues</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software product development can help solve efficiency and miscommunication-related issues. Once your company starts experiencing low efficiency or miscommunication-related issues, you may be ready for software product development. One way that it can help fix these problems is by providing employees with a centralized system where they can go to get up-to-date information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, new tools such as Microsoft Flow provide an automated way of handling repetitive tasks.</span></p>
<h3><strong>When Your Supply Chain Has Many Bottlenecks</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your supply chain has many bottlenecks, consider looking into software product development. With the use of software products and software development services, these dilemmas can be solved, and your business will run smoothly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following are some signs that your company might need to create a software product:</span></p>

<h3><strong>When your Business is Growing</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As your business grows, you may need software product development services to keep up with the demands of your company. For example, as you become more successful, you might find that your previous tools no longer work well enough or have enough features to handle your needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also need software product development because of the changing market and new technology. Whatever the reason for needing software product development services, you want to be sure that it will be worth it before investing in them.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When Your Customer Base Increases</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things you&#8217;ll notice when you&#8217;re ready to begin software product development is that your customer base has increased. This might be because your business has grown or because you&#8217;ve been able to reach a new audience. An increase in customers can signify that it&#8217;s time to start looking into the next phase of your business, which includes developing a software product.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether building an app, developing a website, or releasing another physical product, the decision will ultimately depend on your goals. Once you know what type of software product will best suit your needs and vision for the software application development company long term, hiring software developers will help bring your idea to life.</span></p>
<h3><strong>When you Business is Expanding to Other Locations</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When expanding your company to other locations, it&#8217;s time to invest in software product development. Utilizing a product that is already established and has already been tested will make your company more efficient. Plus, you&#8217;ll save a lot of money because you won&#8217;t need to spend money on developing software from scratch. An existing product can also be very beneficial when expanding internationally. </span></p>

<h2><b>How To Prepare For Software Product Development?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By preparing for your software product development project, you can ensure that everything goes smoothly and that your final product is of the highest quality. There are a few things you should keep in mind to ensure success. Here are four tips on how to prepare for software product development:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_27754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27754" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-27754 size-full" title="How To Prepare For Software Product Development" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-To-Prepare-For-Software-Product-Development_.jpg" alt="How To Prepare For Software Product Development" width="800" height="2018" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-To-Prepare-For-Software-Product-Development_.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-To-Prepare-For-Software-Product-Development_-119x300.jpg 119w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-To-Prepare-For-Software-Product-Development_-406x1024.jpg 406w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-To-Prepare-For-Software-Product-Development_-768x1937.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-To-Prepare-For-Software-Product-Development_-609x1536.jpg 609w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-27754" class="wp-caption-text">How To Prepare For Software Product Development</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Define your Target Market</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who will you be selling your software to? It&#8217;s essential to have a good understanding of your target market before starting development, as this will influence everything from the features you include to the way you market your product.</span></p>
<h3>Research the Competition</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What other software products are out there that serve the same or similar purpose as yours? Knowing your competition will help position your product in the market and make it stand out.</span></p>
<h3>Create a Detailed Specification</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting development, it&#8217;s important to create a detailed specification of what you want your software to do. This will help keep development on track and prevent scope creep.</span></p>
<h3>Find the Right Development Partner</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right software development partner is crucial to the success of your project. Make sure you take the time to find a partner that has experience in developing similar products and that you feel confident working.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="A Comprehensive Guide on Software Product Development Life Cycle" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1f05gTY-1GM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Essential Stages Of Software Product Development</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software product development is taking an idea or concept and turning it into a tangible, usable piece of software for consumers  to do whatever they wish. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process, no matter how similar it may seem from project to project, never follows the same path or schedule twice, meaning that each software product goes through its unique stages and variations of each stage.</span></p>
<p><b>These stages are as follows:</b></p>
<h3>Ideation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideation is the first stage of software product development. It involves brainstorming and coming up with as many creative ideas as possible. This stage aims to generate enough viable ideas that may eventually lead to a successful product. If you don&#8217;t have enough ideas, ideation can be conducted by a group of people in a brainstorming session. Once an idea emerges from a session, it should be documented so it&#8217;s not forgotten later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step is to decide which ideas are most feasible or desirable for development and try to build them into a prototype or mock-up. You should also try to assign them one or more key features that will make them unique and stand out from other products on the market.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Planning</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning is the second stage of software product development. You are detail mapping out the entire project and its scope during this stage. You will be defining goals for the project, creating a timeline of milestones, budgeting, and defining roles and responsibilities. You will also identify what your team needs to do throughout the project to complete it successfully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, at this stage, you might hire developers or designers if you don’t have those skills on your current team. If your business doesn&#8217;t offer these services, you will start researching companies that can provide these services. You would then reach out to them and send them an RFP (request for proposal) outlining exactly what they need to provide. If they accept your proposal, you can move on to the next stage of developing your product.</span></p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user interface is created and visualized in the design stage. Sketches and wireframes are drawn to illustrate what the interface should look like. Research is conducted to understand better how users will interact with the product. This stage can be divided into low-fidelity wireframes, high-fidelity wireframes, and interactive prototypes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-fidelity wireframes are sketches of what an app or website might look like without pixel precision. Low-fidelity wireframes explore various layout options to determine which best suits a user&#8217;s needs. They don&#8217;t include much detail about color, fonts, or graphics because they&#8217;re not intended to be used as blueprints for development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-fidelity wireframes take it one step further by including more detail about color, fonts, and graphics, but no programming has been included yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive prototypes take it even further by including animation and real programming (though it may not always have finished coding). They give users a chance to see what the product will look like when they use it while still giving developers room to work on new features later in development.</span></p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementation is the process of developing the product and tying together all of the pieces. The first step in this stage is to plan how you want to execute your development. This includes choosing which tools to use, making a timeline, and mapping out where you are in project budgeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, create a list of activities that need to be completed to get your product off the ground. Your list should include what needs to be done, who will do it, when they will do it, and how much time they will take. Finally, prioritize each task based on its importance and urgency, so you know which tasks need to be addressed first.</span></p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the fifth stage of software product development, the product is checked for bugs and errors in software. This stage can be performed by manual or automated testing. Manual testing could involve using paper documents and walking through steps in the software&#8217;s design to ensure it does what it is supposed to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automated testing could involve many methods, such as rerunning loops over and over until certain conditions are met, running a script with a tool such as Selenium to check every web page loaded on a website, and writing scripts that attempt valid user input in an application.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Deployment</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, the software is complete, and you&#8217;re ready to deploy it. There are many things you&#8217;ll need to do before deploying your software, such as: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Install the software on a server. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a new database or configure an existing one. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Configure the deployment using administration tools like FTP or SFTP. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Configure any third-party services (e.g., Google Analytics) that you want to integrate with your application. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Configure any email notifications for alerts and outbound marketing campaigns.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Export backup information and other configuration data. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run performance tests to make sure everything is running smoothly. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get the latest security updates from the developer&#8217;s site or another trusted source. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test in different browsers on different operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X). Test the system when it has limited bandwidth available. Test it when there is no network connectivity at all. Test it when only one browser is installed on the system where you&#8217;ve deployed your application (i.e., ensure your site still functions even if a user doesn&#8217;t have Chrome installed).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Deployment should be well planned and orderly; otherwise, errors will happen during deployment, which could cause downtime of critical resources.</span></p>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your app is fully released, the development process isn’t over yet. Ongoing maintenance and updates are necessary to keep your app running smoothly and up-to-date with current trends. Here are some things to consider after completing stage six of the software product development process:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Analyze data for bugs and glitches reported by users during the testing phases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) Create a schedule for routine updates, patches, and fixes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) Update coding language to comply with new programming standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4) Address any security concerns as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5) Monitor feedback from testers to ensure you’re meeting user expectations and needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6) Consider implementing new features and updating existing ones based on customer requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7) If changes require an update to program code or additional programmer work, re-evaluate their prioritization based on the cost they will incur in terms of time and resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8) Continue monitoring technology trends related to your product so that you can continue providing relevant content or services to your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9) Provide customer service support by responding promptly and courteously when customers contact you with questions about their use of the product or services provided through it.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>How To Select The Right Partners For Software Product Development?</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software product development process is a long and complicated one, involving many different partners along the way. From designers to developers to marketers, it takes a team of experts to bring a product to market. But how do you know which partners are right for your project? And how can you ensure that everyone is on the same page, working towards the same goal?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we will explore selecting the right partners for software product development.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Conduct A Background Check On The Company</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When selecting a software development partner, conducting a background check on the company is important. This will help you ensure that the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-development?utm_source=Organic+-+ValueCoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software App Development Company</a> is reputable and has the experience and expertise necessary to produce a high-quality product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To conduct a background check on a software development company, start by searching for the company online. Review the company&#8217;s website and look for customer testimonials or case studies. You can also search for the company in Google News to see if there are any recent news stories about them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, check out independent review sites like Clutch or G2 Crowd to see what real customers say about the company. Finally, contact the company directly and ask them any questions about their experience or process. By taking these steps, you can be confident that you&#8217;re selecting a reputable software development partner.</span></p>
<h3>Check a Company&#8217;s Ability</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are looking to partner with a software development company, it is important to check their ability. This includes looking at their portfolio, case studies, and reviews. Checking a company&#8217;s ability will give you an idea of the quality of work they can provide and whether they are a good fit for your project.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Knowledge Of Different Methodologies</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have the knowledge and experience with different methodologies. This is important because it will ensure that they are able to adapt to your specific needs and requirements. Furthermore, it will also allow them to provide you with the best possible solution for your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of different software development methodologies that partners can use, so it is important to make sure that they are familiar with the ones that you are interested in. Some popular options include Agile, Scrum, Lean, and Kanban. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also a good idea to ask about their experience with other tools and technologies you plan to use for your project. This way, you can be sure they can properly support your development process.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Ability To Support Throughout The Cycle</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideal partner will provide support during the entire development process, from initial planning and requirements gathering to final testing and deployment. They should also be able to provide ongoing support and maintenance after the product has been launched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When evaluating potential partners, ask them about their support model and what level of support they can provide throughout the development cycle. Find out if they have a dedicated support team or if they outsource this function. Also, inquire about their post-launch support offering and whether they offer bug fixes, security updates, and new features as part of this service.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Ability to Understand Your Business</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right partner for software product development should clearly understand your business. They should know your company&#8217;s goals, objectives, and values. Furthermore, they should be able to understand your target market and audience. With this knowledge, they can help you develop a software product that meets your customers&#8217; needs and helps you achieve your business goals.</span></p>
<h3>Capable Testers</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As your software product development partner, one of our primary objectives is to help you achieve high quality for your end product. Achieving this goal requires the involvement of highly skilled and capable testers who understand the nuances of testing software products.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of an MVP in Software Development is to validate a product idea quickly and cheaply without incurring the cost and risk of developing a full-fledged product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By starting with a small, imperfect product, businesses can gather feedback from early adopters and iterate rapidly to create a final product that better meets the market&#8217;s needs. While MVPs have become popular in the software industry, they can be applied to any type of product development.</span></p>

<h2><b>Role Of MVP Development Services In Software Projects </b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26147 " title="Role of MVP in Software Development" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Role-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png" alt="Role of MVP in Software Development" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Role-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Role-of-MVP-in-Software-Development-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching a new software development project is always risky. There&#8217;s no guarantee that the finished product will be well-received by users or even work as intended. MVPs are often used to test new ideas and gather feedback from users, helping to reduce the risk of launching a full-scale development project. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, an MVP can be built relatively quickly and cheaply, making it an appealing option for startups and small businesses. Building an MVP also has the benefit of helping to focus the development team on the essential features of the product. By starting with an MVP, you can avoid wasting time and money on features that may never be used.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ultimately, whether or not to build an MVP is a decision that depends on the risks and rewards of your particular project. But in many cases, an MVP can help to reduce the risks of launching a new software development project.</span></p>

<h3>Determine The Direction of Design</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an MVP helps you validate the concept and get a fresh perspective regarding the features and interface elements that users may expect from a similar product. The data collected becomes handy in developing and designing the software to fulfill the audience&#8217;s expectations. </span></p>
<h3>Improvised Functionality</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP development services ensure the system&#8217;s proper functioning aligns with the business vision. Getting custom features in a product requires a skilled and resourceful team for better functioning. It is better to catch the bugs or any other deficiency in the development stage to avoid delays after the final release.</span></p>
<h3>Develop a Unique Set of Features for The Product</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An innovative MVP in Software development aims to solve recurring problems with understandable working principles. It enables you to make an easy-to-use product. The users get a faster and more efficient solution to their problem, and the development teams get their desired outcomes.</span></p>

<h3>Precise Project Planning</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working on a minimum viable project imbibes the full concept of software. It decides on features and technology stack selection. MVP often works as a reference point while working on a product.   </span></p>
<h2><b>Benefits Of An MVP In Software Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It aims to get the product out to the market quickly, so it can begin generating feedback from real users. First, it allows for more rapid iteration and experimentation. Since only the essential features are included in the MVP, there is less code to write and test. This makes it easier to make changes and try out new ideas. Second, an MVP can help to reduce development costs. By starting with a smaller scope, it is possible to cut down on costly features that may never be used. Finally, an MVP  can help you get your product to market faster. By focusing on the core functionality, you can get your product in front of users sooner and begin gathering critical feedback.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26150 " title="Benefits of MVP in Software Development" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Benefits-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png" alt="Benefits of MVP in Software Development" width="541" height="406" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Benefits-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Benefits-of-MVP-in-Software-Development-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></p>
<h3><b>Present A Better Picture To Stakeholders and Investors</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups include minimum viable products in their pitch deck. An MVP in software development gives investors and stakeholders a risk-free decision-making process. It helps increase your brand awareness and attract skilled talent with an improved vision and upgraded idea of your functional product.</span></p>
<h3>Better Cost-Efficiency of The Project</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP gives a better outlook of the necessary features required for the product&#8217;s success. It helps avoid unpopular methods among the beta testers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP helps the teams avoid building excess complex solutions. The development and maintenance costs witness an exponential reduction and a better understanding of the required talent before hiring extensive departments.</span></p>
<h3>Retain Focus on The End Goal</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP reduces uncertainty and deters the team from procrastination. It helps shorten the feedback loop and enhances the overall development speed. </span></p>

<h3>Less Room for Error</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project gets more complex with the increased involvement of people and systems. The development process becomes harder to control. Newcomers in software development get used to the system. It avoids complexity and reduces potential errors. <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mvp-app-development-company?utm_source=Web+Blog&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=ValueCoders" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">MVP development services</a> help reduce system shutdowns and facilitate maintenance management.  </span></p>
<h3>Better Relations with Prospective Customers</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP prepares the viable groundwork for product development. The development teams create a solution for the audience as the marketing team builds connections and spreads the word around the web. It enables you to attract daily active users to your future product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While an MVP in software development has many benefits, it is important to remember that it also has some risks. First, since an MVP is usually released with few features, it may not be able to meet all of the customer’s needs. This could lead to early user attrition. Second, an MVP may generate negative feedback if it is not well-received by the market. It is important to have a plan for how you will address this feedback before releasing your MVP. Overall, an MVP can be a great way to develop and release your software product rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being productive is key to success in any field, but it can be difficult to maintain a high level of productivity day after day. That&#8217;s where the MVP system comes in. MVP stands for &#8220;minimum viable product.&#8221; The idea is to create the simplest possible version of your product or service that still meets your customers&#8217; needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It enables you to avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary details and to stay focused on what&#8217;s most important. Additionally, MVP development services help you get customer feedback more quickly and make better use of your limited resources. Keeping your product or service as simple as possible keeps you focused on what&#8217;s most important and gets it done quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<h2>Successful Businesses that Started With MVP Development</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26151 size-full" title="Famous Companies that Started with MVP Development" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Famous-Companies-that-Started-with-MVP-Development.png" alt="Famous Companies that Started with MVP Development" width="512" height="384" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Famous-Companies-that-Started-with-MVP-Development.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Famous-Companies-that-Started-with-MVP-Development-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are no guarantees in the business world, developing a minimum viable product (MVP) can increase your chances of success. MVPs allow entrepreneurs to test their assumptions about a product or service before investing significant time and resources. If the MVP is well-received, it can provide valuable feedback that can be used to fine-tune the final product. Launching an MVP can generate buzz and create interest in a business before it is fully up and running. It helps attract potential customers and investors. Many notable companies have started with MVP development, including big names like Dropbox, Airbnb, and Tinder.</span></p>
<h3>Meta (Formerly Facebook)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started with the name &#8220;The Facebook.&#8221; As an MVP product, it helped American students stay connected with friends from other schools. Initially, it became operational in four universities. Access was granted to everyone without any geographical barrier after it was successfully tested for a year.</span></p>
<h3>Dropbox</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox is a known file-hosting company. It implemented the MVP approach in the form of an explanatory video that demonstrated the possibilities and innovative functions of the technology. Surprisingly, signups increased 5 times in just one night without an actual product.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it has over 600 million users. By testing the business hypothesis and learning the actual market needs, Dropbox used the MVP strategy without releasing the actual software.</span></p>
<h3>Groupon</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original idea was changed/modified with time to meet the market needs. As an MVP product, it gathered people with the intent of helping each other and running a crowdfunding campaign or boycotting some negligent stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original idea was modified to gather people for a crowdfunding campaign and boycotting negligent stores. Users started promoting its special coupons and promo codes. Manual emails were sent to individual customers for effective resolution of the requests. It helped save costs on software development and get better results from testing the product viability that later served global customers.</span></p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started as an SMS communication platform among Odeo, a podcasting platform, and employees. The MVP product provided only an SMS-sending facility without hashtags, replies, reposts, etc. Later, it developed into the modern world of Twitter with all its accustomed features.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development has been around since the early <strong>1980s</strong>. Many businesses have turned to custom and off-the-shelf solutions. It is the best way to solve problems by using custom business logic without spending too much time and money on development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of software development spans centuries, not decades. From the first adding machine to calculate square roots hundreds of years ago, the technology has been advancing. Our civilization has been improving technology in ways previously deemed impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, those hardware and software upgrades brought some great advancements. It includes calculating calendars or even retail applications like letting customers buy things on credit. Moreover, Custom software development has always been a challenge for many companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A custom software project can be complex and time-consuming, which is why it&#8217;s important to have best practices in place to mitigate the risk of failure. So here, know which challenges and risks you can face while custom software development and how you can alleviate the risk with best practices. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Is Custom Software Development?</strong><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22512  aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/custom-software.jpg" alt="custom software development" width="854" height="477" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/custom-software.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/custom-software-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development is the process of building a custom solution for an organization&#8217;s needs. Customized solutions can come in many different shapes and sizes, such as mobile apps with specific features to fit your company branding or web applications that give customers easy access to their account info no matter where they are on any device.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many organizations choose this method because they are looking for something that&#8217;s not available in the market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development entails much more than just writing code to make an app or website work a certain way. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Process of developing custom software application</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>The process of developing a custom software application involves the following steps:</strong></em></p>
<h3><b>Define your needs:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before proceeding with any development or implementation plan, it&#8217;s important to first define your needs. This is the most critical part of any software development effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is because you want to make sure all requirements are clearly identified, documented, and analyzed for feasibility before writing a single line of code or designing screens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will help assure that everyone involved in this project is on the same page when it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comes time to start development work, and it also gives you a clear idea of your end goal. If </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you don&#8217;t take this step; it&#8217;s easy to lose sight of your project goals and get sidetracked by other nonessential features.   </span></p>
<h3><b>Specify the requirements:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once there is a clear understanding of what needs to be done, the next critical decision revolves around deciding how much work should actually go into each requirement before developing any solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you&#8217;ll need to do some careful analysis of requests and determine how they align with the business needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a customer comes up with an idea for a mobile application that can display all their products in one place, so they never have to worry about forgetting what&#8217;s on sale or running out of inventory, then this request is a great use case for some mobile-friendly web application.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just remember not to prioritize requests based on how interesting they are to you but rather on how much they&#8217;ll benefit the company&#8217;s business goals.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all possible features are listed out and sorted with proper priority, then it becomes easier for developers to determine which requests can be completed in less time without compromising their overall project objectives. </span></p>

<h3><b>Determine the budget: </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting any development work, it&#8217;s important that everyone involved in this project is informed of the costs that are associated with it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes time, resources, and any additional expenses that might be needed to successfully complete a project. Without having an accurate estimate for how much work will go into each request, you run the risk of overspending on your budget or not being able to deliver features as quickly as you should. </span></p>
<h3><b>Define the scope:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once everyone has an idea about how long it&#8217;s going to take and what things are expected of them, then the next step is defining a clear scope for this project. This means detailing exactly how much work will be done on each request before moving on to other tasks or features that might come up later on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a solid roadmap is in place, it becomes easier for everyone involved to focus their efforts and make sure they&#8217;re spending time on the right tasks at any given moment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Establish milestones:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common practice among project managers when developing custom software applications is establishing short-term goals or checkpoints known as milestones. These are used to monitor progress, finalize requirements and ensure that everything is on track before continuing work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of milestones needed will vary depending on the size and complexity of a project, but they&#8217;re usually set at certain points in order to hit deliverables or key events such as initial development kickoff, launch date, or adding new features. This way, there&#8217;s always a clear idea of what has been achieved and how much work is left until the project is completed. </span></p>
<h3><b>Designing and Development:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the necessary groundwork completed, it&#8217;s time to start designing and developing your <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-development?utm_source=webblogwhitepaper-22511-customapplication&amp;utm_medium=S05" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">custom software application</a>. This is where you&#8217;ll need to make sure you have a solid team of developers who are well-versed in the latest technology trends as well as best practices for efficient development workflows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, in order to form a leading software, it&#8217;s important to use attractive UI/UX design, appropriate programming languages, and technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python are the most preferred programming language for software development.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22514" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22514" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22514 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/languages.png" alt="Programming Languages" width="598" height="489" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/languages.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/languages-300x246.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22514" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                              Image Source:</strong> GoodFirms</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the globe, Linux is one of the most popular software development platforms.</span></p>

<h3><b>Testing: </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don&#8217;t want to miss one tiny detail during this process. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to test each small piece of the software development chain before moving on and adding more features or functionality. </span></p>
<p>The best way to check whether there is any bug in your app or not. For this, you need to do beta testing, which can be done by asking clients to test the application.</p>
<h3><b>Deployment and Marketing:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deploying your custom software is not less important than any other phase of the development process. If you are deploying an app online, then first create a landing page for that particular app to tell people about it, and on that, insert Google Analytics code so that you can track visitors coming from different sources, i.e., search engines, referrals, etc.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, you need to promote your app and make it popular among the masses. You can do so by putting ads on different Google Adwords platforms or Facebook pages, and so on…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, by taking help from a recognized </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>custom software development company</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can manage all the custom software development processes in a simple and agile way.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Risk and Challenges Involved In Custom Software Development</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development is challenging work that comes with many risks. Like any project, there are always unforeseen circumstances that can happen along the way. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of some common risk factors involved in custom software development:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22516" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22516" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22516 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/challenges.png" alt="Risk and Challenges" width="655" height="570" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/challenges.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/challenges-300x261.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22516" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                           Image Source:</strong> GoodFirms</figcaption></figure>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>You&#8217;re Overly Ambitious</strong> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although you might think your idea is unique, there is a good chance that the features and requirements already exist in </span><b>custom software development </b><b>solutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Without looking into available options before diving headfirst into development, this can lead to wasted time and money when you realize it&#8217;s not what was needed after all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This typically happens with startups where the founder wants to create something that is much more than what they originally intended. </span></p>
<h3><strong>The Solution Is Not Solved</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&#8217;re working with custom software development, there&#8217;s always a chance that the solution isn&#8217;t solved in such a way that it&#8217;ll actually benefit the company moving forward. This could be because requirements were misunderstood or not well thought out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without making sure that the solution fits into your business model, it might not be worth all of the time and energy you put into development, to begin with.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Project Don&#8217;t Have Purpose</strong></h3>
<p>Without a clear purpose for the software you&#8217;re creating, it&#8217;s likely that your project will be abandoned. It may get limited in some way. Without having a solid goal to work towards, there is no direction. In fact, nobody can determine if they are reaching success because things like ROI cannot be calculated.</p>
<h3><strong>Poor Reach and Communication</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most projects need a team of people working together to make sure everything is completed as it should. There should be proper reach and communication from the team. Without this, things can slip through the cracks or not be done as they were intended. It ultimately leads to frustration on all ends. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Inaccurate Development Estimates</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to custom software development, most projects are done on an Agile or Waterfall model. These models require accurate estimates of the time and resources needed for each step in order to avoid going over-budgeted hours and having a team sitting around waiting to move forward with other parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Without planning properly and accurately estimating, you&#8217;re likely to see a lot of wasted time. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22517" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22517" style="width: 812px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22517 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reasons.png" alt="Estimates" width="812" height="387" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reasons.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reasons-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22517" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                                 Image Source:</strong> 99Firms</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>How To Alleviate The Risk Of Failure With Best Practices?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to avoid failure is by doing your research. You must know what you&#8217;re getting into before developing the software. This will help weed out any bad ideas or projects that are not feasible at the beginning of a custom development project.  </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Here&#8217;s how to reduce risks and challenges:</em></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Start with an MVP</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must start with an MVP (minimum viable product) if you want to reduce the risk of failure. Also, make sure you&#8217;re getting one that&#8217;s proven. This is a critical step in mitigating your risks early on while still allowing room for changes if needed.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Start Small</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to mitigate challenges during custom software development is by starting small and then expanding. This way, if something goes wrong with any step of the process, you can just go back to the previous stage and fix it instead of having to start all over again. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Prioritize</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another best practice is prioritizing your project in order to make sure everything gets done on time while minimizing risk. Make a list for every task, and then determine the order in which you want to do them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these best practices, you can reduce your risks of failure when custom software development is involved. Customizing a solution for your business needs may be complex and time-consuming, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be risky if you&#8217;re aware of all possible challenges ahead of time.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Communicate Frequently</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development requires a lot of communication between you and your developers. To reduce risks, make sure to communicate frequently about what&#8217;s going on with the project so there are no surprises later down the road or misunderstandings that can cause delays.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Technical Risk Mitigation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to custom software development, there are many variables that can cause challenges. </span>Technical risks include things like whether or not the code is maintainable and reusable for future projects. Moreover, this can be a case if all requirements have been met by everyone involved in the project.</p>
<p>There are also organizational risk factors such as a lack of communication between your team members. However, it may be if there are too many people working on the project at one time.</p>
<p>By following these risk mitigation best practices, you can avoid many of the major risks and challenges. This usually comes with developing a custom software solution for your business. The more prepared you are ahead of time, the better off you&#8217;ll be on project completion, and this is what a company wants?<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, most tech startups, in fact, enterprises have drifted away from developing new software products in-house. But is it right to stop growth in the face of a disaster such as this?</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the novel coronavirus is as big as a problem as it gets. But the world will eventually come out of it. At that time, would you want your startup to take its time to freshen up and understand the needs of the market? Or would you want to start preparing a great software product so you&#8217;re ready when the market needs it most?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure your choice would be the latter, but most businesses have their hands tied. They&#8217;re unable to operate due to lockdowns, disruption in supply chains, unavailability of staff, and out of myriad problems created by COVID-19. Yet, there are few businesses that are fortunately <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/covid-19-are-we-ready-to-face-this-global-adversity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">working as smooth as ever</a>, especially in the software outsourcing sector.</p>
<p>So if a business (maybe yours) is unable to work on an in-house software project due to COVID-19, is it a wise choice to outsource it to an <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">offshore software development company</a>? Why outsourcing is important? What are the benefits of outsourcing a software development project?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, if you&#8217;re a tech startup in desperate need to capitalize on an opportunity and establish a market presence, then:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1- This isn&#8217;t the best time to run your business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2- Once we&#8217;re done with COVID-19, the state of the market at the time will present unprecedented opportunities that startups could capitalize on. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the same time, your startup could be competing with 100s of established enterprises looking to capitalize on the same opportunities.</span></p>
<p>Is there something you could to have an edge over potential competitors in such a scenario?<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong> Product Development Outsourcing</strong></a> could be the masterstroke for a competitive advantage in the long-run. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-3822 size-full aligncenter" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg" alt="outsourcing product development" width="800" height="628" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development-300x236.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you may know, there are multiple options available in the market to build functional software products. However, when it comes to startups, there&#8217;s a conventional line of thought which says that the benefits of outsourcing are for enterprises only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you can certainly outsource product development as a startup and this is important to your business as well, especially in this pandemic situation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Benefits of Outsourcing</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple benefits of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing IT and software development services</a>. let&#8217;s start with cost.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cost-cutting</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing a budget is a big challenge for startups. However, outsourcing helps a lot to do it right. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In fact, according to a research, 87% of US companies outsource product development to save cost.  </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing provides a global talent pool at a low cost. You hire a backend developer (in-house) at  98000 USD/year and it comes down to 22000 USD/year when you outsource.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The risk is lesser</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of new products whose market is yet to be tested, outsourcing plays an important role in mitigating the risks of trying out something new. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Since the outsourced teams work on flexible models the risks are definitely lower.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>It&#8217;s Faster</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing the development helps in faster development with the Agile model and helps in tremendously reducing the time to market. </span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Technical Expertise</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may be new to the market. That&#8217;s not an issue until you have technical expertise with you. If you already have that, then it&#8217;s good, however, if you don&#8217;t- then it is better to outsource.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Free up time and more focus</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For startups, investing time into high priority things is very important. One of the greatest benefits of outsourcing is that you free up your time for other important things. This helps a lot.  This image will show you some other reasons why is outsourcing important:<br />

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>key steps for your startup to effectively outsource product development</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b><b>Choose the Right Vendor</b></b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right vendor for outsourcing application development is a must. An <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=blog_al&amp;utm_medium=startup_prodev_3816&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing company with expertise</a></strong> in the required development skills will surely be helpful. Picking up freelancers is definitely not advisable, as they cannot be relied upon, for taking up product ownership. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the important points to consider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while selecting a vendor for outsourcing development is the flexibility of hiring models. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps the startup choose a hiring plan that will optimize the costs of outsourcing in accordance with the development requirements. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important to evaluate the portfolio of the hiring vendor to understand the level of specialization in different business verticals.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Defining The Scope Of The Project</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second most important step in outsourcing your product development is to define the scope of the project. First, you need to convert the business idea into a business plan and then put down what all you need from a successful product. Defining the technology with which you wish to develop your product is another crucial decision. This also helps in defining the skill levels of the teams you wish to hire. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the scope of the project is defined and the vendor for product development has been chosen, the service level agreement with the vendor can be created. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps in ensuring that the outsourced teams are working according to the plan of action. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outsourced teams must be clearly communicated about the expectations and the milestones. This helps in developing mutually beneficial relationships with the outsourcing partner.</span></p>

<h3><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Communication</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping in touch with the outsourcing partner on a regular basis and reviewing project work in progress on a constant basis is important. This is helpful in improving project productivity levels. Motivating remote teams with incentives and appreciation is helpful in getting better business results.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overall, a continuous communication helps you to finish tasks smoothly.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you think that the success of a software development approach project is closely tied to the chosen software development approach?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you heard it right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the different software development methodologies, </span><b><i>Agile and Waterfall are among the most popular </i></b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDLC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b><i>SDLC methodologies </i></b></a><b><i>in the present.</i></b></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13090 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-vs-waterfall-success-rates-2013-2017_blog-2-1.jpg" alt="Agile Vs Waterfall" width="858" height="503" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-vs-waterfall-success-rates-2013-2017_blog-2-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-vs-waterfall-success-rates-2013-2017_blog-2-1-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-vs-waterfall-success-rates-2013-2017_blog-2-1-768x450.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-vs-waterfall-success-rates-2013-2017_blog-2-1-600x352.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dilemma of choosing the right development methodology is the same with software development teams and entrepreneurs who are always looking out for the right development approach for different projects and businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before digging into the dissimilarities, let us have a closure look at what they are and their strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is Agile Methodology?</strong><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13091 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-738x800-1.png" alt="Agile Methodology" width="493" height="535" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-738x800-1.png 738w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-738x800-1-277x300.png 277w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-738x800-1-600x650.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile methodology focuses on the continuous iteration of development and testing during the entire software development process. This form of SDLC model increases communication among clients, developers, and testers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software development approach was developed by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ambler" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b><i>Scott Ambler</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the autumn of 2000. Though initially dubbed Extreme Modelling (XM) was later renamed as Agile Modelling at the suggestion made by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b><i>Robert Cecil Martin.</i></b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Agile approach is an iterative and team-based approach to software development. It is a distinct type of Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model. A relatively newer software development model as when one compared to the classic Waterfall Model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you opt for an Agile based development approach, your project is divided, time-boxed, into phases called </span><b><i>sprints.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every sprint encompasses a defined duration, typically, in weeks, with a list of deliverables that were planned during the start of the sprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deliverables are prioritized in terms of the business value which is determined by none other than the client(s). The Agile methodology conforms subsequently to a high level of customer involvement throughout the entire software development process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be cases when the planned work for a particular sprint can’t be completed for some reason(s), then, in that case, the entire work will be reprioritized while the information gained is used for the upcoming sprint planning.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: Dosis, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 14pt; letter-spacing: 0.2rem; text-transform: uppercase;">What do you understand by the Waterfall Software Development Approach?</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13092 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/waterfall-800x797-1.png" alt="Waterfall Methodology" width="800" height="797" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/waterfall-800x797-1.png 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/waterfall-800x797-1-300x300.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/waterfall-800x797-1-150x150.png 150w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/waterfall-800x797-1-768x765.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/waterfall-800x797-1-600x598.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/waterfall-800x797-1-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waterfall, also known as the traditional approach to software development, the waterfall model follows a linear approach to software development. Because of this, it is also known as the </span><b><i>Linear-Sequential Life Cycle Model.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first description of the Waterfall model was deprived of the word Waterfall, which was first cited in the feature article by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_W._Royce" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b><i>Winston W. Royce</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1970. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is in the year 1976 in which a paper by </span><b><i>Bell and Thaye</i></b><b>r</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is believed to feature the term Waterfall for the very first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Waterfall Model follows a sequential approach, hence the project development team can only move on to the next stage if the previous phase achieves successful completion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile and Waterfall development methodologies are distinct forms of software development methodologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you have a software development project that has evolving or uncertain requirements, then it is ideal for you to use the Agile methodology. On the other hand, if you have smaller software development projects with definite requirements, then you can find the Waterfall model to be your best pick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope that the aforementioned comparison will make it easy for you to make a selection among the two popular SDLC models. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Software engineering implies writing codes that are capable of solving deterministic problems applying logic. But owing to the recent growth of AI, the way software programmers program codes have changed recently. Thanks to the revolution of AI and machine learning in software development for problem-solving, using AI software tools has changed the mindset of the programmer.<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-35984" title="AI Software Development Tools" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ai-1.jpg" alt=" AI Software Development Tools" width="703" height="422" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ai-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ai-1-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ai-1-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ai-1-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ai-1-480x288.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/a-realm-of-evolution-of-artificial-intelligence-to-next-gen-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">evolution of AI</a> has changed the software development circuit for real. Artificial Intelligence has facilitated the processing of large amounts of data and it is an application of individual technologies operating in tandem allowing the computer to perform actions generally reserved by humans.</p>
<p>AI Software Intelligence has been helping the software development arena in various verticals:</p>
<h2>How AI is used in Software Development?<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12880" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/157657242286323405.png" alt="AI in software development process" width="768" height="332" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/157657242286323405.png 908w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/157657242286323405-300x130.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/157657242286323405-768x332.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/157657242286323405-600x259.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></h2>
<h2><strong>AI can be used in Software Development for a multitude of purposes:</strong></h2>
<h3>1. Automated Debugging</h3>
<p>AI software and tools can be used in automated debugging through pattern detection for an in-depth analysis, identification, and categorizing of error types. The deep learning algorithm can easily flag-off errors and speeds up the debugging procedure.</p>
<p>It can even go toe-to-toe with software developers and even learn how to fix each type of bug. Post-training, the machine will be able to automatically spot and correct a huge number of mistakes. Think of it as similar to the text auto-correct feature in smartphones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m comparing it to text auto-correct because AI software suffers a similar issue as seen in the former- the same annoying effect of correcting that user might experience especially in the case of no correction requirement.</p>
<h3>2. Smart assistants</h3>
<p>AI software assistants are gaining popularity day by day since they intelligently fasten the development process. It even helps novices to learn about the development environment more speedily than the trial and error method.</p>
<p>AI software assistant tools can play the role of a trainer and come up with recommendations, offer code examples and prevent simple coding mistakes like closing parenthesis.</p>
<p>A great example of this is Kite, an assistant developed for Python.</p>

<h3><b>3. Automate Code Generation</b></h3>
<p>Coding from scratch is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To combat the issues of money and time constraints, researchers have built programs that can write code beforehand. But these solutions are not very good with ambiguity.</p>
<p>In this case, AI software programs came into the picture. It will reduce the workload by a significant amount. Once it masters the underlying patterns, more than code completion, an AI-based software could generate a program by putting together some predefined modules just like LEGO pieces.</p>
<p>In the future, AI software has the potential to replace the task of junior software programmer. This could be the baby steps toward a self-programming machine.</p>
<h3><b>4. Intelligent-Testing</b></h3>
<p>Throughout the development cycle, testing has been one of the most crucial elements while you build a quality software product. One of the major challenges that software programmers face while testing out software products is creating a thorough list of use-cases as well as situations that could have an impact on the program’s performance.</p>
<p>AI software tools can perform this by going through the previous logs and automatically generating a list of test cases for running through the system. It can also predict the outcomes of testing without even performing the actual tests.</p>
<p>It only focuses on the solution, hence saving a huge chunk of time.</p>

<hr />
<h3>5. Designing strategy</h3>
<p>Usually, software developers spend a significant amount of time deciding the features and functionality to be added to a software product.</p>
<p>AI software development tools trained on past software development projects and business factors can analyze existing software and can find a solution, fulfilling the requirements for both the clients and software engineers.<br />
It can produce a hierarchy of the best features for the success of a solution based on user reviews of similar solutions and client marking.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce&#8217;s Einstein is a set of artificial intelligence and machine learning tools that are designed to offer developers an easy way to add these capabilities to their Salesforce apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main tool, Einstein Vision, is designed to analyze images and then recognize objects within those images. The platform is designed to understand individual objects and the relationships between them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it can tell you that it sees a picture of a cat sitting next to some food on a table. Then, it can classify both images and objects, so you know exactly what you&#8217;re looking at from image A (cat) or image B (food on the table).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounds easy enough, but there&#8217;s quite a bit of power behind these tools, and they work incredibly well.</span></p>
<p><b>Key Features of Salesforce Einstein:</b></p>

<h2 style="padding-left: 160px; text-align: left;"><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong></h2>
<p><b>What is AI software development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence software development is a field of computer science that focuses on building intelligent systems. This includes developing computer programs that can perceive and understand their environment, plan and make decisions, solve problems, learn from experience, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These systems are used for a variety of practical applications such as planning and scheduling, manufacturing, controlling robots and other devices, aircraft or vehicle navigation, medical diagnosis, and treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scope of AI is restricted to tasks that are amenable to statistical or rule-based methods; however, in practice, it often involves many other techniques, including neural networks, case-based reasoning (CBR), natural language processing), machine learning, among others.</span></p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ai/application-development-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>AI development company</strong></a> specializes in creating and implementing these intelligent systems to cater to specific business needs and requirements, leveraging cutting-edge technologies and methodologies in artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
<p><b>What are the benefits of using AI software?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence software can help solve some of today&#8217;s software problems but also increase development costs. The following are some possible benefits and challenges of using artificial intelligence in your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, more information on how to work with these technologies is available. This should assist you in making a more informed decision about what you would like to include in your projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you require additional service or want to learn more about any of these prospects, please contact us. We are always pleased to discuss ways we can help your business become even more successful!</span></p>
<p><b>What challenges occur while AI software development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When using artificial intelligence software, there are two critical challenges you must overcome. The first is to develop algorithms that define how an application functions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll then need to write code that manipulates data and transfers knowledge among your artificial neural network nodes or units of computation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll also want to test your artificial intelligence software and tweak your algorithmic and coding strategies as you work out potential bugs in your designs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there is what&#8217;s known as explainability. Machine learning systems often use deep learning approaches in which insights are extracted from various levels of abstraction; human programmers can explain why a particular classifier performs well but not how it came up with its conclusions. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 million businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are given birth every year? You will be shocked to know that approximately 50% of small</span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> businesses fail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the first five years of their business. This clearly shows a loophole in the business process.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we will be soon dealing with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will probably see more businesses dying. The economic impacts of the novel coronavirus will create a graveyard of failed startups, small-scale businesses, and even a few large-scale enterprises. How will your business prevent itself from making a place in this graveyard?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here the need to optimize the business process arises. The prime weapon applied to achieve such optimization is IT services. This has given a major boost to the IT outsourcing sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to research by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technavio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><b><i>rising need to optimize business processes will be the key driver for the IT outsourcing market</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is estimated that during 2019-2023, the IT outsourcing market will grow at a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CAGR of 4.42%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/7-benefits-of-hiring-it-outsourcing-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of IT Outsourcing</span></a></h2>
<h3><b>Save infrastructural cost</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you hire software developers, your investment in giving them the right infrastructure to develop your software will get saved.</span></p>
<h3><b>Save the cost of in-house software developers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business is not required to <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-html-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire developers</a> full-time in their office. Hiring full-time employees add to the cost even if there is no need for software developers. </span></p>

<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #2: Need for more specialization</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are those days when the software was created just to take your business online or to make it compatible with the latest industry happenings.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideas have become the essence of software industries. If you have an idea of getting a custom app developed, it will solve half of your problem. This is why in future businesses will shift to business models that will safeguard their idea. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New business models in the IT outsourcing industry will be </span><b><i>based on outcomes rather than outputs</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Do you know the difference between the two? The output is the result of the organization’s activities and the outcome is the level of success achieved by these activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will increase the pressure to deliver impeccable results to the software developers. The future models will also be witnessing contracts wherein the risk and responsibility will be shared among businesses and the IT outsourcing partner. </span></p>
<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #6: Less attention on cost</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I have written that business models will be more focussed on quality rather than the mere completion of work. Along with this shift, the focus from cost has also shifted. Businesses will no longer run behind the lowest cost quotation by software developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we cannot deny that a true businessperson will always focus on cutting their expenditures. But the value delivered has taken the place of primary concern. An ideal <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">IT outsourcing company</a> will be the one with skilled labors and outstanding outcomes at the least cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the </span><a href="https://agileengine.com/top-outsourcing-destinations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost of developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and QA in different popular IT outsourcing destinations. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12513" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-1-min.png" alt="Cost of developers in Top IT Outsourcing countries" width="869" height="500" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-1-min.png 869w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-1-min-300x173.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-1-min-768x442.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-1-min-600x345.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with this, you can match the skill ratings of the </span><a href="https://www.pixelcrayons.com/hire-app-developers?utm_source=vcsg&amp;utm_medium=vcsg&amp;utm_campaign=vcsg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="exclude"><span style="font-weight: 400;">app developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in different locations. The quality-price match can be an ideal choice for any business developer. For example, India is a destination with low-cost developers and placed at a considerably good rank among different destinations. Such combinations are in high-preference for developers. </span></p>
<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #7: Demand for cybersecurity and compliance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the industry of information technology, security becomes a primary area of concern. Since its inception, this industry has been facing threats and thefts. When top-notch companies like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook witness such security issues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it brings fears into the SMEs and startups as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has raised awareness among businesses which has turned into a demand. Companies demand that high-end security measures should be taken while developing an application for their business.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12515" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-8-min.png" alt="Cyber attack preperation" width="700" height="366" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-8-min.png 700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-8-min-300x157.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-8-min-600x314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my friends started a startup for an e-commerce store. He was not well-informed about the security checklist that should have been followed by his </span><a href="https://www.pixelcrayons.com/hire-web-developers?utm_source=vcsg&amp;utm_medium=vcsg&amp;utm_campaign=vcsg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="exclude"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hired web developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Once he got his web app developed, he faced issues in the payment gateway. The sensitive data like card details of customers who were logged into his e-commerce site started getting leaked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very small experience that I have witnessed very closely. A business can face a lot of such issues when it comes to security. This is why </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/01/07/83-of-enterprise-workloads-will-be-in-the-cloud-by-2020/#edeb1786261a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">66% of IT professionals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think that security will be the primary concern while adopting cloud computing. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12516" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-2-min.png" alt="Cyber Security" width="737" height="383" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-2-min.png 737w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-2-min-300x156.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-2-min-600x312.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data encryption still has a long way to go. Cybercriminals have not and still not leaving any stone unturned in attacking the sensitive data.  IoT devices are at the most vulnerable position when it comes to cyber-attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a report by </span><a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/press/releases/spiceworks-study-reveals-wifi-attacks-challenge-it-professionals-keep-data-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spiceworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only 36% of IT professionals are confident in their ability to respond to cyber-attacks. This is quite scary! If the IT professionals are unsure then who are we relying on the safety of our data onto! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undoubtedly, in the future, the demand for optimum security from IT outsourcing companies will be on a rising spree.  In order to survive in the competition, it will become a necessity for IT outsourcing companies to provide highly secure applications. </span></p>
<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #8: Rise of New outsourcing destinations</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major destinations for IT outsourcing are located in Eastern Europe, South America and Asia pacific. These are the top destinations mentioned in the table below.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12517" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-2-min.png" alt="Top IT Outsourcing Destinations" width="871" height="319" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-2-min.png 871w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-2-min-300x110.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-2-min-768x281.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-2-min-600x220.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These locations have the largest share of global outsourcing revenue. Today India and China are the leading destinations among these fourteen locations. The export of the IT industry of India in 2019 is expected to reach </span><a href="https://www.ibef.org/industry/information-technology-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">135-137 billion US dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is being speculated that in future years central and eastern European countries will provide stiff competition to China and India. As of now, according to a </span><a href="https://www.backofficepro.com/white-paper/outsourcing-to-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 59% of the respondents are already outsourcing their </span><a href="https://www.pixelcrayons.com/custom-software-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="exclude"><span style="font-weight: 400;">custom software development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> services from India. Here is the complete graph of their findings:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12518" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-3-min.png" alt="Companies outsourcing software development services" width="623" height="533" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-3-min.png 623w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-3-min-300x257.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-3-min-600x513.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, in my opinion, India will continue to lead the IT outsourcing destinations with maximum projects. Few reasons for the same are:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Supportive policies by the Indian government for IT companies: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, the government of India provides schemes for the fiscal benefit of IT companies. Moreover, it has also recognized IT as of the 12 champion service sector. </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Indian companies follow international quality standards: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these standards are the International Standards Organization (ISO 9000), Six Sigma Quality Certification, Total Quality Management (TQM), etc.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The abundance of developers: <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/271988/android-app-developer-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, India has the second-largest number of Android developers in the world. </span></b></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Moreover, India has the most hardworking force:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In a survey, </span><a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/jobs/indians-are-most-hardworking-workforce-in-the-world-survey/1377344/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">69% of the Indians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expressed satisfaction in working for 6 days a week.

It can be summed up that India will emerge as an even more flourishing IT outsourcing destination for businesses all over the globe. </span></li>

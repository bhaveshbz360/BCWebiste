										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 2021, retail eCommerce sales amounted to approximately 4.9 trillion U.S. dollars globally. This figure is expected to grow by 50 percent over the next four years, reaching about 7.4 trillion dollars by 2025. With platforms like WordPress and Shopify, today it is easier for businesses to create an online store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress has long been the leading platform for starting a website, while Shopify is well known as an easy way to set up an online store and start selling products or services immediately. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many great reasons to choose either of these platforms, but they come with pros &amp; cons that you should consider while deciding which way to go. </span>WordPress vs. Shopify,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is best for your business? In this blog, we will compare both‌, so you can determine which will be right for your requirement.</span></p>
<h2>wQuick Overview</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify and WordPress are two of the most popular eCommerce platforms on the web. When choosing which platform to use for your site, it&#8217;s important to weigh factors such as cost, scalability, and design focus. Let&#8217;s inspect and compare </span>WordPress vs. Shopify<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you make an informed decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress &amp; Shopify offer free plans available to users, but they differ in functionality. While you can build an online store on both platforms, WordPress is geared more towards bloggers and website owners than those looking to launch an online store. You&#8217;ll need to use a theme designed for eCommerce if you want your site to sell products or services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms can create your website, but WordPress is the more versatile option. It&#8217;s free to download, easy to install &amp; edit yourself, and there are many plugins (like WooCommerce) that you can use to build an online store.</span> <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/top-wordpress-development-services-company-india?utm_source=Organic+-+ValueCoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">WordPress Website Services Company</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will guide you through setting up a business page with great content and then implement Search Engine Optimization techniques to rank it on search engines for the specific product or service you offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Shopify is a turnkey solution. It&#8217;s not free, but you don&#8217;t have to do anything other than plug in your content to get your store up and to run. It has many add-ons and partners that care for things like marketing, design, and customer service. It means you&#8217;re paying a monthly fee and won&#8217;t be able to control every element of your business like with WordPress.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Setup &amp; Hosting In WordPress &amp; Shopify</strong></h2>
<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p>WordPress Vs Shopify, <span style="font-weight: 400;">which one has better setup and hosting features? Let’s start with WordPress. You&#8217;ll need to download and install the software on your web hosting. Once you have a hosting account and the installation is complete, you&#8217;ll be able to log in to your dashboard. Here, you will find all of your WordPress settings. You&#8217;ll be able to upload themes from here, manage plugins and build a network of users who can log into your site and edit content without breaking anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In WordPress, a theme controls your website&#8217;s design. Once you&#8217;ve logged into your dashboard, you&#8217;ll be able to upload a new theme and customize its settings by changing background images, uploading custom header graphics, and inputting text into content areas. These themes come with unique features, such as sidebars that can be managed within specific post types to include different ads or calls-to-action throughout different posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, WordPress is entirely open-source. You can download the program to your computer and run it there (or on a hosting provider). You&#8217;ll pay just a one-time license fee and, most times, nothing to host it. Plus, if you&#8217;re working with a theme from outside the WordPress store (like from somewhere like ThemeForest), you&#8217;ll need to install the theme manually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes about ten minutes for anyone who knows what they&#8217;re doing; some of that time is just connecting files properly. Setup and hosting in WordPress are free, but you must deal with updates. Themes are also free in most cases, but you&#8217;ll have to handle updates yourself. And when you want an add-on like WooCommerce for selling goods online, you&#8217;ll need to purchase that.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3>Shopify</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One important aspect to remember when comparing </span>WordPress vs Shopify <span style="font-weight: 400;">is that a hosting service is required to run WordPress. Shopify provides both hosting and a customizable storefront. If you own an eCommerce website, using one service that manages everything makes sense to spend more time building your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosting in Shopify also includes security features like firewalls and malware scanning, unlimited bandwidth, storage space, and data transfer. With a hosted site on Shopify&#8217;s platform, you get automatic backups each day, which means if something happens to your site, there will be a copy stored offsite just waiting for restoration! No need to worry about manually backing up files or managing your server&#8217;s storage space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business needs will dictate what platform would work best for you. It is worth considering the traffic your site generates, how frequently content updates are needed, whether you have technical skills, and how much control over design and branding you want to have before making a decision. </span></p>

<h2><strong>Security &amp; Support In WordPress &amp; Shopify </strong></h2>
<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important consideration is the site&#8217;s security. WordPress sites are typically more secure than those running on other platforms because over 50% of the internet&#8217;s websites use the platform. Plus, as a self-hosted platform, WordPress has a stronger safety net since you can update it as needed. And if something goes wrong on your WordPress site, you&#8217;re equipped with tools to diagnose and fix it quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With WordPress, you can use free and open-source software, although your site will not be hosted on a secure server unless you upgrade to a paid plan. If you want more options for customization and support, then it’s best to Hire WordPress Developers to  build your online store. It’s important to consider WordPress hosting cost, too; it might prove difficult if you don’t have a developer who can set up all of these components.</span></p>
<h3>Shopify</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is also an issue with both WordPress and Shopify. While it’s not unheard of to be hacked, many security breaches happen due to mistakes made by those running a website, such as installing third-party plug-ins that introduce vulnerabilities into your site or failing to keep your software up-to-date. It is essential to keep everything up-to-date at all times. If you are not sure how to do it yourself, then consider hiring someone who does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shopify, your data is encrypted through SSL and hosted on the fast and secure Amazon Web Services platform, making your website secure. You get more control over your content because you don&#8217;t have to edit the code to make changes on your site- an important aspect that may save time and headaches in the long run. If a technical issue arises with your website, help is available 24/7 to resolve any problems.</span></p>
<h2><strong>WordPress &amp; Shopify: Price Comparison </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an open-source content management system, WordPress costs nothing . You can set up a free website and blog within minutes.  It has four level plans, Personal, Premium, Business, and eCommerce, that help you grow your business with the help of an error-free website. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26791" title="WordPress Latest Price" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price.png" alt="WordPress Latest Price" height="844" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price.png 1700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-300x149.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-1024x508.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-768x381.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-1536x763.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px" /> WordPress Latest Price</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://wordpress.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Image Source</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify offers four levels of monthly plans: Starter, Shopify, Advanced, and Shopifyplus for enterprise-grade solutions. The first two are the least expensive. The advanced plan includes 24 hours of support.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26792" title="Shopify Latest Price" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price.png" alt="Shopify Latest Price" height="654" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price.png 1599w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-300x123.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-1024x419.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-768x314.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-1536x628.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1599px) 100vw, 1599px" /> Shopify Latest Price</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.shopify.com/in/pricing?term=shopify%20plans&amp;adid=566070193615&amp;campaignid=15433369407&amp;branded_enterprise=1&amp;BOID=brand&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1ICZBhAzEiwAFfvFhMu_-1mfLa7HWPWC-NM5yezXQkW2relnHIWNNidEYhQpsrJQF0WkhRoCIIgQAvD_BwE&amp;cmadid=516585705;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494758;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Image Source</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a more cost-effective option, consider Shopify. You won’t get live customer support with a standard account, but you do have access to their large knowledge base. For $14 per month on a basic plan or $29 per month on an unlimited plan, you can have your domain name and website with ease of use, similar to WordPress.</span></p>
<h2>Help &amp; Support</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is also an issue with both WordPress and Shopify. While it’s not unheard of to be hacked, many security breaches happen due to mistakes running a website, such as installing third-party plug-ins that introduce vulnerabilities into your site or failing to keep your software up-to-date. It is crucial  to keep everything up-to-date at all times. If you aren’t sure how to do it yourself, then consider hiring someone who does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shopify, your data is encrypted through SSL and hosted on the fast and secure Amazon Web Services platform. This makes your website more secure than if you used WordPress. Additionally, you have more control over your content because you don&#8217;t have to edit the code to make changes on your site- an important aspect that may save time and headaches in the long run. If a technical issue arises with your website, help is available 24/7 to resolve any problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, WordPress is just as important to install reliable plugins and keep them updated. Instead of paying monthly fees, </span>WordPress Website Services Company <span style="font-weight: 400;">charges per hour, which can add up quickly depending on the complexity of your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress security and support offers three layers of protection against hackers &#8211; file system level security, brute force login protection, and firewall protection from denial of service attacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will always have access to online resources (forums) to solve problems without paying monthly hosting fees. You will never need to bother about downtime as every hosting provider provides a 99% uptime guarantee, but you should take steps to protect your site with a backup plan before launching, so there are no surprises if something goes wrong.</span></p>
<h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to SEO, there are some differences in terms of technology and focus. WordPress is a blogging platform primarily built around optimizing content for Google. In contrast, Shopify is designed primarily as an eCommerce store builder, so while they have options for creating content like blogs and galleries within their site, their focus is mostly on providing the best experience possible for shoppers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms offer integrations with platforms like Google shopping ads or Facebook ads. But since each has a different design philosophy, these integrations might not work the same way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both platforms can build online stores, each allows you to host and share your content. So if you are struggling to decide on </span>WordPress Vs Shopify, <span style="font-weight: 400;">consider your requirements; you may need to determine where you are currently in your blogging journey.</span></p>

<h2>Market Tools &amp; Features</h2>
<p>In comparing WordPress vs Shopify, now let&#8217;s look at the market tools and features of each platform. Both offer unique tools &amp; features that might or might not meet your business requirement. For a better understanding, let us look at the features of both platforms and decide which one best suits your business:</p>
<h3>Shopify:</h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can start the online store without investing much money, which is good news if you are running on a shoestring budget. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can have your store functioning in minutes using what’s known as a theme. It’s a website template designed to be easy to install. It  will save you work hours because all you have to do is add content, images, and prices. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify doesn&#8217;t offer a lot of integrations. It offers apps from Google and Facebook so that you can sync your social media accounts with your storefront.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that need more than just those two integrations (like MailChimp) might want to consider another provider like Bigcommerce or Squarespace.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms allow customers to buy anything from physical goods to digital products.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>WordPress:</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress is open-source and available to download for free, so if you’re interested in using it to power your website, you can do so without having to pay a dime or commit any money upfront.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress also has an active community of developers and bloggers who are always updating the platform with new features and improvements on the go, which means that the software will never grow outdated over time.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There is no shortage of plugins compatible with the core WordPress program, as well as a variety of other third-party products that help automate everything from SEO management to shipping logistics.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress is best suited for individuals with little to no programming experience who want a free way to manage their online store. On the flip side, those looking for more advanced features should look into Shopify instead.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Themes are essential when designing a professional-looking website. WordPress offers a range of pre-made themes (free and paid), but there are still not quite as many options available compared to Shopify.</span></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong>Cons</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Less flexibility on storefront end: </strong>Unlike Magento, the WordPress eCommerce platform doesn’t offer extensive customization features for building an online store. It comes with a set of predefined themes and plugins that limits you to very basic customizations options such as changing colors or rearranging menus in your website.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Therefore, if you want advanced functionalities like built-in marketing tools, better SEO options, and more payment gateways, you will have to invest in premium themes.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">WordPress doesn’t support all types of eCommerce functionalities: </strong>The WordPress platform is great for blogging purposes, but totally lacks when it comes to offering advanced features needed by the eCommerce sector, such as multi-currency functionality or product bundles.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">About Magento</h2>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">The Magento is built on the Symfony framework, which makes it an open-source eCommerce platform, offers excellent features for online store development, and allows users to build their own customized applications through its programmatic interface. The CMS provides both front-end and back-end development functionalities and is a great choice for customizing your website as per your business requirements.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros</strong></h3>

<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">It’s too complicated for beginners: </strong>The biggest drawback when working with Magento is its complexity as you need extensive knowledge about coding languages such as HTML, CSS, etc., to manage the platform. It’s not so user-friendly and doesn’t offer support for third-party themes or plugins, which means you will be required to <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-magento-developers?utm_source=webblog&amp;utm_medium=wordpressvsmagento-22216-d7&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">hire Magento developers</strong></a> who have expertise in the Symfony framework.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">WordPress vs Magento: Difference Between Both Platforms</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">While both Magento vs WordPress is excellent eCommerce platforms, some major differences can make you choose one over another. The below-mentioned points will highlight this differentiation between them:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">• The main difference is in their coding language. You have to code using PHP for Magento, whereas with WordPress, you don’t need any coding knowledge.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">• Another difference between these platforms lies in their architecture, which results in different technical support options available for them. You will find tons of resources available online about WordPress users’ issues as compared to the ones related to Magento.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">• WordPress is easy to use and offers good support, but Magento has limited resources. So you need the help of a professional <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-development-services?utm_source=webblog&amp;utm_medium=wordpressvsmagento-22216-d7&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">eCommerce development services</strong></a> for it.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">WordPress vs Magento: Choosing The Best eCommerce Site Builder Platform</h3>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Here I have mentioned a few parameters on comparing these pointers; you will be able to know which eCommerce development platform will be best for online store development.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Performance</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">WordPress is lighter and faster, as it takes up lesser resources than other eCommerce website development platforms. Moreover, Magento has an inbuilt caching feature to provide high-performance to its users, which makes both the options equally good for performance.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Code Quality</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">While Magento scores highly in terms of code quality, WordPress is not so good. However, as per the latest versions, it has improved a lot and now offers better quality than before. Also, the new Gutenberg editor for Magento seems to be buggy, which makes both platforms equal on this front.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Security</strong></h3>
<p>Since it is an open-source platform, WordPress offers a host of plugins that can be used to manage and enhance your website security. On the other hand, Magento has low chances for malware or hacks due to its strong back-end code quality.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Customization</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The ease of customization depends upon how much control you have over things. Magento offers full control to its users and allows them to make changes according to their needs. WordPress, on the other hand, is easy for beginners but not so good when it comes to customization as you won’t have much flexibility while performing advanced tasks in comparison with Magento.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Ease of Use</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Both eCommerce website development platforms are equally good in terms of ease of use. However, the Gutenberg editor for Magento needs a lot of improvements to make it more user-friendly and easy to work with as compared to WordPress.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Support</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Both platforms offer support through community forums or official documentation but don’t have dedicated customer service teams. Also, since both are open source, you will find ample information online through various blogs and forums to resolve your queries.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Popularity</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">WordPress is more popular than Magento, which may be a crucial factor for most E-commerce businesses when choosing open source eCommerce platforms as per their project’s needs and requirements.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Plugins</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">WordPress offers more than 50,000 plugins, whereas Magento has around 15,000 modules and add-ons. So WordPress wins the game if we talk about plugin support for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">eCommerce website development</strong></a>.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>9. Hosting</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Magento requires you to purchase your own hosting service, as it is a self-hosted application. However, WordPress is a hosted CMS and can be easily installed on your preferred hosting service provider.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>10. SEO</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">WordPress is better than Magento when it comes to SEO as the former allows you to make changes in your permalinks structure, improve page titles and meta descriptions for all posts. On the other hand, Magento needs customization at a code level, which makes it difficult for beginners who are new to website development or eCommerce store owners looking for quick solutions.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>11. Pricing</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to pricing, Magento offers free plans for basic functionalities, but if you need certain features and advanced functionality, then there are paid plans. On the other hand, WordPress is completely free.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>12. Functionalities Offered</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you want a CMS that has extensive features related to the eCommerce sector, such as product bundles, coupons, etc., then go with Magento. However, if you want a blogging website only, then go with WordPress.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">WordPress vs Magento: Comparison Table</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">Website development can be really challenging if the team does not fit completely into the business requirement. The functionalities of a website must be constantly tested rectified for any issues.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The WordPress Developer you hire must have a thorough knowledge of the platform and should be able to make changes and upgrades on the site in a smooth manner. Getting the right set of dedicated developers to work on your project can add great value to it.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why Should You Hire WordPress Developers?</strong></h2>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Website Must Fit Your Needs</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">A WordPress developer is always well-versed in many of the standard coding languages used to create most WordPress themes and plugins. He or she can further tweak your purchased theme so that it works exactly how you want, whether its colors changing on a per post basis, adding new widget areas where needed, etc.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In addition, when you <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-wordpress-developers?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=hirewpdev-2798-d7&amp;utm_campaign=webblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>hire WordPress programmer</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">,</strong> he/she can craft a website from scratch based on how you envision it to look and work.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A lot of people don’t know that they have the power in their hands when choosing their own site design, which means there’s never been an easier time than now for entrepreneurs who want more freedom over what goes onto theirs!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Optimize Your Website For Search Engine</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When optimizing websites for search engines, most business owners tend to focus on applying on-page SEO techniques like including targeted keywords within their web page content and tags.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Others would build include offsite strategies such as guest posting into the mix but what many have been unaware of is the third type — Technical Search Engine Optimization or “Technical Seo” for short which can be used in order to make your site architecture easier (and more readable) by making use structured data, so bots are able easily to navigate through them!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Technical SEO means more than just including keywords in your content and tags. It’s all about making sure the website architecture, structured data are optimized so search engine bots can easily “read” it!</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Easy Customization</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Inevitably, you will think of ideas that need a developer immediately. For example: offering an online quiz on your site so users can determine which offer is best for them, and their needs could be easily created by one knowledgeable in this field.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If there isn’t already someone who knows how to do it when we find ourselves without developers at our disposal (imagine if they became unavailable), then all those plugins sitting idly just waiting until needed might as well stay where they’re put because once again-their performance impacts SERP rankings negatively anyway.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">WordPress is the ultimate tool for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/top-wordpress-development-services-company-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>WordPress web development</strong></a>, any business looking to quickly and easily create their own website. It has thousands of plugins that can be used in order to customize your site’s appearance, making it easy enough even if you’re not an experienced web designer.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, there are chances when I do have clients who need help picking out just what they want because sometimes all these options confuse us more than anything else — which leads me back again to “paralysis by analysis.”</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Improve User Experience</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">WordPress users are experts at optimizing the user experience for your site. They know that now, more than ever before, people want a simple and engaging website — which is absolutely what you can get from WordPress professionals! Search engines also reward sites with better rankings on these factors: dwell time (how long someone spends browsing) as well as page speed performance.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This means if you have an expert who has been trained in optimizing websites, so they rank higher by Google search algorithms, then trust them over any other company out there because this will give YOU credibility first hand instead of relying upon third party opinions or tools alone-even though those might be reliable too but getting personal feedback ensures 100% satisfaction guaranteed all round.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Enhanced Search Engine Optimize</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">WordPress management professionals and WordPress experts for hire possess the tools and expertise to improve your site’s search rankings. They are adept at implementing on-page optimization techniques for better SERP results, such as using keyword insertion in tags or meta description — all of which is possible with a little know-how from these SEO experts!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">And you won’t believe what they can do next: spy on competitors by collecting their top sources sending traffic away from yours so that we may apply knowledge gained through this research towards helping our client rise higher up page one listings faster than ever before imaginable.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Optimize For Mobile</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Google made the mobile experience a top priority in 2018 and gave higher rankings for sites optimized for small screens. That’s why it’s extremely critical than ever to hire professionals who instinctively develop responsive websites, creating flawless experiences on both desktops and smartphones alike with their designs compatible across most browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, or even Safari!</p>

<hr />
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>How would you hire the right set of developers for your site? Here are some questions that you must ask the WordPress developer before having him on board.</strong></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 1 Would you be using an existing theme or a custom theme to build a WordPress Site?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> The idea here is to understand the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">developer’s ability to differentiate</strong> between the options for theming a WordPress site.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">To develop a WordPress site, you can use an existing theme, customize a theme, and create a new theme from the start.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">An <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">existing theme</strong> is inexpensive from the other options but provides less opportunity to customize the website. The design may also be commonly found on other sites as these themes are picked up by many other companies.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Building your own theme</strong> on the other hand has many advantages. It can be customized to specific business requirements and niches. This may cost more but offers options to develop a website with lighter code and one that’s more according to business requirements.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Customizing an existing theme</strong> is also an option but has challenges with respect to incorporating updates in the theme.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Try to decipher, whether the developer has clarity with respect to the above options and why would he suggest a particular option for your project.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 2</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How would you Simplify content management on my website?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> Managing the content on a WordPress site is usually simple. But, you also need to ensure that your website should be developed in such a way that it can manage all content in a simplified manner.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Here are some things to know before developing a site that makes content management simpler.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">1. Use Widgets to add content on the home page.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">2. The Menus feature in WordPress for adding menus on the site.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">3. The templates feature for maintaining the structure of the page.</p>
<p> 4. The Slidebar feature in WordPress must provide adding footer and sidebar content</p>
<h3><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong" style="font-size: 12pt;">Q. 3 What would be the basic plugins required while building a WordPress website?</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> WordPress provides a host of plugins for adding different functionalities to your website. This feature makes it one of the most sought-after CMS in today’s times.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Here is the list of some of the basic plugins to install when you are creating a website related to the following:</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 4</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How would you make the website user-friendly for all devices, including the mobile phone?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> The mobile device has become the most used device for reaching out to your target audiences. Or, you can make a website mobile-friendly only if it has capability to create a mobile version of itself. The second most common method is to create a responsive site that works well across devices.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 5</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What are the basics of hosting a WordPress website?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> Here are the points to consider while choosing a hosting solution provider for your business</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="padding-left: 40px;">1. The disk space and bandwidth are according to the specific business requirements.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="padding-left: 40px;">2. Reliability and quality of the solution provider</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Third-party access to hosting settings</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="padding-left: 40px;">4. The geographic location of the host</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 7</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How will you manage the backup of the WordPress site?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> Every WordPress website needs back up especially when you end up losing the data on your site. There are quite a few backup solutions available online, that help in backing up your website.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 8 What will a developer do to improve the speed of my WordPress site?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Ans. It takes a lot to keep people interested these days. Even if you make your website as easy and intuitive as possible, they’ll still leave after 3 seconds of loading time- which is why it’s so important for developers or companies not only to understand how crucial fast page loads actually can be but also do everything in their power (especially on mobile) towards achieving them!</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 9 How would you ensure the security of my WordPress site?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Ans. You should definitely ask your potential developer or company whether they will be using the newest security measures to protect your website. If not, don’t hire them!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So many hackers are targeting WordPress sites because of their popularity in this industry — so you need someone who can keep it safe for you too. Moreover, you need to ask about their backup procedure as well. This is because things can go wrong at any moment with all these attacks constantly happening on various platforms like Facebook etc. Hence, It will give you no peace until user data get compromised again.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 10 Will you be able to turn a WordPress site into an eCommerce store in the future?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Ans. Being an online store owner, you may be wondering how to take your WordPress site and make it into something that looks more like brick-and-mortar retailers. You’ll want to check with developers about whether they specialize in eCommerce development for WooCommerce specifically because this type of programmatic software is what powers many stores today!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP vs WordPress is one of the best-debated topics in the modern web development world. Several new web technologies have brought many recent changes to this domain. But as we all know <strong>“Old is Gold”. </strong></span></p>



<p style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Yes, you are thinking right! </b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even having various new web ruler technologies, businesses are still relying on some old yet strong web technologies. Here, I am talking about two master web technologies, i.e. PHP and WordPress. </span></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People had discussed a lot about them. You can find many articles discussing <em>PHP pros and cons, advantages of PHP, </em></span><em><a href="https://hackernoon.com/php-or-nodejs-top-tips-to-pick-the-right-technology-for-your-project-0lh31bs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">PHP vs NodeJS</a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/ecommerce-cms/best-cms-tools-to-start-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">WordPress vs Joomla</a>, PHP vs WordPress war, etc<strong>.</strong></em> But this is not the answer to all your queries. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the best between PHP and WordPress would consume your time, money, and your manual efforts too. In this fast-paced world, you can save these things by considering a well-formed piece like this. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we will look at some pointers profoundly and develop the desired result of the war between “PHP and WordPress”. Let’s begin the discussion with a small brief on both web technologies. </span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><b>PHP &amp; its frameworks:</b></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s first understand “what a PHP framework is?”. You will surely need a good knowledge of coding for<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/web-application-development?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=phpwordpress-17331-s11&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> website development.</a> PHP itself is a web programming language that helps you in developing awesome websites, web applications, and other tools with ease. It is the language that empowers WordPress, so it&#8217;s more than adequate for building your website.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for a &#8220;PHP web framework&#8221;, you can think of this <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/how-to-choose-the-right-technology-stack-for-your-web-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">web development language</a> as a flexible template. You will often find that certain powerful functions are involved within a framework, based on the various philosophies and goals of the creator, although that is not a prerequisite.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP web development frameworks provide you with the necessary elements</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and act as the bare-bones foundation to build a website. But this is not a complete solution for a full-fledged website. You may require to </span>hire PHP developers<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to accomplish this task as they will use their web development skills. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This difference can help you in making a decision between PHP and WordPress. </span></p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><b><strong>Question: Which will offer a great user experience between PHP and WordPress?</strong></b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A user experience (UX) is an important concern for all website owners, especially those who develop sites in-house. The ease of use of the chosen platform will play an important role in its efficiency and the effectiveness of the final product.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/popular-php-frameworks-to-watch-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>PHP framework </strong></a>is basically designed for developers, dealing with a level-programming language low, the UI/UX is usually pretty basic for them. On the other hand, a CMS like WordPress serves as a low technical entry point for developing a website, attaining an attractive graphical user interface (GUI) is key. Hence, a CMS like WordPress will be ideal if you need clarity during development and use.</span></p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><b>Question: Which platform between WordPress and PHP will provide great security to apps?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security, being the primary concern of all website owners, represents a huge difference between PHP and the WordPress CMS. In case, it fails to secure your site properly, regardless of your goals, it can result in sensitive data leaks into the wrong hands.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, this could lead to all kinds of financial and legal issues. This makes choosing the best between a PHP or CMS framework more than a matter of preference as it will directly affect the success of your brand or business.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, a WordPress CMS could be considered more secure, as the inherent security can be built into the platform itself. However, a PHP framework is considered a lower-level solution in terms of security. Here, you can essentially add the security features you need into the basic functionality of your site.</span></p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><b>Question: Which provides quick and constant upgrades in the war of WordPress vs PHP?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we know that the Internet is a constantly evolving technology. And, we are keen to get constant updates and bug fixes that keep the wheel spinning efficiently and also help website visitors stay safe.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will often find that a CMS like WordPress will receive near-perpetual updates to add new features, bug fixings, improve security, and work on the user feedback. For instance, WordPress maintains a roadmap that describes the platform&#8217;s main release history, which is very active.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, a PHP framework does not usually update as consistently as WordPress does. This is because of the responsibility for improving various functionalities and security features with the help of a developer who works directly with the language. However, this does not make it less stable in theory.</span></p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><b>Question: Which one between WordPress and PHP offers more flexibility and custom development options?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People often argue that flexibility is not always a primary concern, especially when you have a clear idea of what you are trying to achieve with the site you are developing. In those cases, choosing a niche-specific solution would be more suitable.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But consider many third-party services you can use, especially if you are running an e-commerce website. For instance, order processing, marketing platforms, and many other tools and features should be seamlessly integrated into your chosen site-building solution.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A CMS generally offers many options, and this is particularly true when it comes to the WordPress platform. However, the adaptability for those with specific requirements is usually less than that provided by a PHP framework. As with security, a PHP framework offers a broader scope for what it can accomplish, a great thanks to its low-level architecture.</span></p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><b>Question: Which is more SEO friendly between WordPress and PHP?</b></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO(Search engine optimization) plays an important role when you develop a website as it directly influences your site’s rank in the search result of Google. To rank better in Google, your website content should be refined and fresh, which affects the overall quality of your website. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, WordPress is preferred more over PHP because it comes with several built-in features and extensions that can improve your technical SEO. It includes SEO plugins, XML sitemaps, and permalinks.  </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are some other SEO concerns to be taken care of viz. Good keyword research, quality content and rank methodologies, etc. </span></p>

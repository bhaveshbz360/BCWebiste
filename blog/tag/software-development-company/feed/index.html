These applications operate on popular operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key characteristics of desktop applications:</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desktop applications are installed directly on the user&#8217;s computer, allowing them to run without an internet connection. They can be accessed through the GUI or a terminal window, often by simply double-clicking their icon to open the main window.</span></p>

<h2><strong>What is Desktop Application Development?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desktop application development involves creating <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">custom software development services</a></strong> tailored to desktop and laptop computers.

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Local Functionality:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Desktop applications are not dependent on internet connectivity and can be fully functional offline.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Diverse Languages: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers utilize various programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, TypeScript, Node.js, Java, C#, C++, Bash, PHP, Swift, Red, Go, and more to create desktop applications.</span></li>

<h2><strong>Major Differences Between a Desktop, Mobile, and Web Application</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When considering the distinctions between desktop applications, mobile applications, and web applications, several key differences come to light:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difference between a desktop application and a mobile application:</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A desktop application operates on stationary machines like desktop computers and laptops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, a mobile application is purpose-built to run on mobile devices, for example, tablets and smartphones.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although akin to computers in many ways, mobile devices come with certain constraints, particularly related to connectivity and storage.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difference between a desktop application and a web application:</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desktop application is a software program installed and run locally on computer devices like desktops and laptops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, a web application is accessed over the internet and delivered from a remote server to a local device.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This distinction is crucial for understanding the dynamics between desktop and web applications.</span></li>

<h3><b>Pain Points of Off-the-Shelf Solutions</b></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Limited Scalability &amp; Flexibility:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As your startup grows, off-the-shelf solutions may become inadequate due to their inflexible, predetermined features, rendering them ineffective in accommodating changing business needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lack of Customization:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Off-the-shelf solutions often fail to meet the specific requirements of startups, making it challenging to tailor them for optimal efficiency. With customization, companies can be unrestricted when improving processes and workflows.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Integration Challenges:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Integrating off-the-shelf solutions with existing systems can sometimes be software that, if incredibly challenging, isn&#8217;t designed to work with your current infrastructure.</span></li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3><b>Cost of Off-the-Shelf Solutions</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of off-the-shelf solutions can vary widely. It depends on the following factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The provider</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Number of features included</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level of support offered. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they typically have a lower upfront cost than custom software, it is crucial to consider the ongoing subscription fees, which can add up over time.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-33025 size-full" title="Examples Of Off The Shelf Solutions" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Examples-Of-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions.jpg" alt="Examples Of Off The Shelf Solutions" width="1200" height="938" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Examples-Of-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions.jpg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Examples-Of-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions-300x235.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Examples-Of-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions-1024x800.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Examples-Of-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions-768x600.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Examples-Of-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions-480x375.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These solutions provide a range of features that can meet the needs of many startups but may offer a different level of customization or scalability than a growing business requires.</span></p>
<h2><b>Custom Software Vs. Off-The-Shelf Solutions</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The choice between custom software vs. off-the-shelf solutions depends on factors such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Your business needs</b></li>
<li><b>Budget</b></li>
<li><b>Long-term goals</b></li>
</ul>
<p>While custom software offers high customization and scalability, it comes with a higher cost and longer development time.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, off-the-shelf solutions are cost-effective and quick to deploy but may need more flexibility &amp; competitive advantage that custom software provides.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Making a Choice Between Custom Software and Off-The-Shelf Solutions</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deciding between custom software and. off-the-shelf solutions requires carefully evaluating your startup&#8217;s needs, resources, and plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups should consider the following key factors to ensure they make the best decision for their unique circumstances:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-33032 size-full" title="Choice Between Custom Software and Off The Shelf Solutions" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Making-a-Choice-Between-Custom-Software-and-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions-1.jpg" alt="Choice Between Custom Software and Off The Shelf Solutions " width="1200" height="889" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Making-a-Choice-Between-Custom-Software-and-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions-1.jpg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Making-a-Choice-Between-Custom-Software-and-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions-1-300x222.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Making-a-Choice-Between-Custom-Software-and-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions-1-1024x759.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Making-a-Choice-Between-Custom-Software-and-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions-1-768x569.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Making-a-Choice-Between-Custom-Software-and-Off-The-Shelf-Solutions-1-480x356.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p><b>Budget &amp; Financial Resources</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups must carefully weigh the financial impact of their decisions. Initially, custom software may be more expensive, but the long-term costs associated with off-the-shelf solutions could prove costly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, both short-term and long-term budget implications must be taken into account.</span></p>
<p><b>Scalability &amp; Future Growth Plans</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your chosen software should be able to grow with your startup. If you anticipate rapid growth or significant changes in your operations, a custom solution that can be easily scaled and modified might be a better fit.</span></p>
<p><b>Time-to-market &amp; Implementation Speed</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a rapid solution is required, off-the-shelf software can be quickly implemented compared to a tailor-made one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, it may be advantageous to devote the time to developing customized software if you have needs that current options can&#8217;t meet.</span></p>
<p><b>Unique Business Requirements</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No two startups are alike, so their software needs won&#8217;t be either. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business&#8217;s demands exceed what ready-made solutions can accommodate, then custom-made software is likely the ideal choice.</span></p>
<p><b>Integration &amp; Interoperability Needs</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A customized software solution is preferred in a scenario where off-the-shelf solutions cannot be integrated seamlessly with existing systems and applications. A tailored solution will meet the unique interoperability needs.</span></p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">About Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Capability Maturity Model Integration, or CMMI, is a framework for improving software development organizations’ processes and product quality. The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute developed CMMI. The model’s five maturity levels increase organizational capability and rigor. Here are the five maturity levels:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">1. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Initial</strong> — New businesses go through an unpredictable environment that leads to increased risks and inefficiency at this stage.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">2. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Managed</strong>&#8211; At this level, companies have formalized their software engineering practices with documented policies &amp; procedures.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">3. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Defined</strong> — These companies have documented plans for improvement at this stage.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">4. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Quantitatively Managed</strong> — Companies have measurement systems that quantify how well they’re meeting performance targets in the project management’s six dimensions (quality attributes) in process areas.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">5. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Optimizing</strong> — Companies must establish metrics and quantitative goals for each maturity level before progressing to the next one. You may outsource some aspects of your software development process at this stage if you don’t have the staff available internally.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The final stage occurs when an organization has achieved all other stages, has established its own metrics system from within, and can reliably assess its progress in improving productivity, efficiency and effectiveness over time through iterative activities.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Benefits of CMMI in Software Development</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a complete process improvement model for developing, maintaining, and acquiring software systems. It is built upon eight capability areas:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Planning, organizing, staffing, directing &amp; controlling the work</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Analysis &amp; design</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Implementation and testing</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Operation &amp; maintenance</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Evaluation of results</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Problem detection</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Diagnosis</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Correction</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">CMMI provides a structured set of processes that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of any organization. CMMI is an invaluable asset to any organization that seeks to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance performance.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One way to ensure the success of CMMI is by training employees on how it works so they can take ownership of its implementation.

<p class="graf graf--p">CMMI is a voluntary standard, which means organizations can choose to use it or not. But most large companies have adopted CMMI in some form. If you’re looking for work as a software engineer, your next employer will likely either be using CMMI or be interested in learning more about it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Overall, the benefits of ISO 9001:2015 are overwhelmingly positive. It will help your business grow by providing a formalized system for quality control and improvement. Implementing this international standard can not only improve your business’s processes, but it can also make you more competitive in your industry.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2024, millennial customers are going digital. As much as they want to surf the Internet, they like to spend their time on Smartphones too. Hence, as a business owner, it&#8217;s your time to make a stronger online presence for a better brand image.</p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How about building a state-of-the-art website? Or a mobile app to stay one touch away from your customers? </span></em></p>
<p><strong>Seems profitable.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Right? </span></strong></p>
<p>But, before you decide to build your app, take a look at the programming trends that most programmers and <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-it-outsourcing-companies-find-the-best-option-for-your-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">IT outsourcing companies</a></strong> are following in 2024. It will help you get a brief idea about which programming language should be perfect for your project.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This article is continuously updated to help you catch up with the latest programming trends and languages.</span></p>
<h2>11 Top Programming language Trends in 2024</h2>
<p>This year, many programming languages have lost their importance and many other platforms have emerged. But that is the general rule in programming, after all. Everything will keep changing, and the best you could do is adapt. So without further ado, let&#8217;s start with the list of the 11 top language trends this year:</p>
<h2> 1) Python</h2>
<p>Python is really gaining all the buzz these days. This language is widely accepted by data scientists and data analysts, it has also become a very useful language for software engineers, software developers, development leads, managers, engineers, system analysts, and <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-web-app-developers?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=topprogramtrends_6840&amp;utm_campaign=webblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">web developers under the umbrella</a></strong> of software outsourcing companies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9769" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends.png" alt="" width="902" height="361" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends.png 902w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends-600x240.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends-300x120.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends-768x307.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends-640x256.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></p>
<p>As per the PYPL Popularity of Programming Language report, Python has a 27.34% market share and is considered to be the most popular language as searched for tutorials on Google. Also, it&#8217;s one of the leading languages that set a programming trend in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<h2>2) Java</h2>
<p>Recently Java has become quite less popular than <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/ai-ml/top-programming-languages-to-build-ai-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">other programming languages</a></strong> are, as a result, it has come down to 2nd place in the PYPL (Popularity of Programming Language) list of 2024. At the same time, Java still finds its place at the top of the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">TIOBE index</a> of most popular programming languages of this year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-31863 size-full" title="tiobe programming index" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiobe-programming-index.png" alt="tiobe programming index-2023" width="1221" height="405" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiobe-programming-index.png 1221w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiobe-programming-index-300x100.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiobe-programming-index-1024x340.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiobe-programming-index-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1221px) 100vw, 1221px" /></p>
<p>Java is much faster than before and with fewer lines of code, a feature-rich application can be built. Even the latest version was released back in 2014 still the features are helpful and save costs for businesses.</p>

<h2>3) PHP</h2>
<p>PHP has been here for a long time. Some say PHP is dying. However, PHP is alive and well also still in programming language trends. With PHP&#8217;s latest version, things are different. In the past, PHP was a simple way to build a few dynamic web pages.</p>
<p>If you needed a bit of variety, you could embed simple code between HTML tags. It was basic enough for web developers to embrace it but slow enough to draw sneers from hard-core programmers.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s easy to execute PHP code faster than ever by incorporating the Just-in-Time compiler technology like Java. Now, tools like the HipHop Virtual Machine and PHP are delivering speeds that are twice as fast as the old versions. Though it has lost market share by 5.1% in the last 5 years, it&#8217;s one of the top languages that IT outsourcing companies prefer to build amazing websites.</p>

<h2>4) JavaScript</h2>
<p>According to <strong><a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2018/08/10/language-rankings-6-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">research from Redmonk</a></strong>,  JavaScript is on the top of the list. And obviously why not!! With the newly released Angular 4, upcoming React fiber, fast-growing Vue.js, feature-packed Node.js, and many other <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-javascript-frameworks-list-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">frameworks and libraries</a></strong>, JavaScript is growing really fast and developers of top IT outsourcing Companies are keener to learn this language than ever.</p>
<p>For detailed comparison: <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/vue-vs-react-which-one-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Reactjs Vs Vuejs: Which One To Choose?</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-6841 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Top-Programming-languages.png" alt="Top Programming languages" width="744" height="435" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Top-Programming-languages.png 744w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Top-Programming-languages-600x351.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Top-Programming-languages-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></p>
<p>Moreover, with the help of JavaScript MV*, it is much easier to build complicated apps with fewer lines of code and taking less time. These web apps are easily turned into cross-platform mobile apps with the help of PhoneGap, Xamarin, and other technologies, which in turn will get your work done in one attempt. JavaScript has a fourth place in this list for the reason that it is an old language and is already quite common for web development.</p>

<h2> 5) Swift</h2>
<p>When it comes to native <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">mobile app development</a>, Swift is the new sensation for iOS. For years, <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-ios-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">iOS developers</a> were dependent on Objective-C. However, recently Swift has entered the top 10 list of programming languages leaving Objective-C behind and the IT outsourcing companies are adopting it at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>Most <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=topprogramtrends_6840&amp;utm_campaign=webblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">mobile app developers</a></strong> confirm that it is much easier than Objective – C. Although Swift isn’t going to replace Objective-C, however, it gains a lot of attention in 2022. With the release of Swift 5 which offers a host of new, developer-friendly features, this new programming language is certainly to stay in the programming trends.</p>

<h2>6) R</h2>
<p>R is the highly preferred language for a growing number of statisticians, data scientists, data analysts, and other analytical types had been enjoying an incremental rise, moving from 15 to a steady 13 and finally jumping to 12 on Redmonk&#8217;s list. Also, every year its popularity has increased constantly. Although the relevance of Python in related fields has overshadowed the former, R still remains one of the top programming trends of 2022.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9788" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R.png" alt="" width="889" height="377" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R.png 889w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R-600x254.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R-300x127.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R-768x326.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R-640x271.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" /></p>
<p>This is principally attributable to a softening in its GitHub ranking in the new process. Unlike its competitor in the analytical space, Python, which rose three spots along that axis, R fell five spots in GitHub programming languages rankings even as its Stack Overflow ranking rose one place. This minor movement, however, says little about R’s current or future performance; like PHP, the language remains popular in spite of a step back.</p>
<h2>7) Ruby on Rails</h2>
<p>Ruby on Rails(RoR) is considered to be one of the favorite languages for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-web-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">web developers</a>. Ruby is a funny programming language that makes developers happy at work. Some big brands like Hulu, Airbnb, Basecamp developed their websites with RoR.</p>

<p>Though Ruby has lost its importance a bit, still it is highly preferred by IT outsourcing companies. The latest 5.0 version has many new features and can build web apps faster. As per Redmonk&#8217;s list, Ruby has occupied 7th ranking, and it&#8217;s in the programming trends as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6881" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruby-Programming-trends.png" alt="Ruby Programming trends" width="817" height="370" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruby-Programming-trends.png 817w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruby-Programming-trends-600x272.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruby-Programming-trends-300x136.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruby-Programming-trends-768x348.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px" /></p>

<h2>8) Goo</h2>
<h2><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9792" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends.png" alt="" width="860" height="375" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends-600x262.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends-300x131.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends-768x335.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends-640x279.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></h2>
<p>Go also benefited from the new ranking model, jumping four spots in the GitHub portion of our ranking system, which wasn’t enough to keep up with Swift, which leapfrogged it. To some extent, this isn’t a surprise, as Go had neither the built-in draw of <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ios-application-development-company-india?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=topprogramtrends_6840&amp;utm_campaign=webblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">iOS mobile app development</a></strong> nor is it generally positioned as a front and back end language as Swift increasingly is.</p>
<p>More to the point, while it might have held static, a ranking of 15 in the list of the top programming language trends is impressive for an infrastructure runtime. Hence, many IT outsourcing companies are focusing on this language, and it has set new programming trends among developers.</p>

<h2>9) TypeScript</h2>
<p>Of all the top-tier programming trends in languages, none jumped more than TypeScript on GitHub rankings. While it also saw improvement in its Stack Overflow ranks, it was the GitHub improvement that vaulted it nine spots up and into the Top 20. As Angular is playing a vital role in TypeScript, it can be one of the major factors in rising suddenly.</p>
<p>Also in the PYPL Popularity of Programming Language trends report, it has the 15th rank</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6882" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Typescript-programming-trends.png" alt="Typescript programming trends" width="677" height="261" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Typescript-programming-trends.png 677w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Typescript-programming-trends-600x231.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Typescript-programming-trends-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /></p>
<h2>10) Kotlin</h2>
<p>Kotlin is rising very quickly these days and changing the programming trends. It&#8217;s holding 19th position in the PYPL Popularity of Programming Language report.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6883" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kotlin-Programming-Trends.png" alt="Kotlin Programming Trends" width="729" height="173" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kotlin-Programming-Trends.png 729w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kotlin-Programming-Trends-600x142.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kotlin-Programming-Trends-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p>There are many reasons for this. The major reason is that Kotlin is now an official language for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/android-app-development-company-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">android app development</a>. In fact, Google itself declared that Android app development will be Kotlin-first at its annual developers&#8217; conference, I/O 2019.</p>

<p>While Kotlin comes with Java on multiple fronts, its ability to both leverage the JVM and interoperate and intermingle with Java code is enormously important. Moreover, it offers top-notch tools and has numerous growing supporters. This is why IT outsourcing companies are getting into this language this year.</p>

<h2>11) Scala</h2>
<p>Scala, a general-purpose programming language, has been designed to be concise and fulfill the shortcomings of Java mostly. Its source code is intended to be compiled to Java byte code to allow the resultant code to run on a Java VM. Also, as its name suggests (Scala is a portmanteau of scalable and language), Scala is designed to grow as one of the top programming trends along with its rise in demand.</p>
<p>Hence, it has a great demand among IT outsourcing companies who know the shortcomings of Java and use it as a replacement. Scala also acquires 11th place on Redmonk&#8217;s list and gets popular every year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the whole globe. During this pandemic, most of the enterprises(small to big) adopted remote working for employees and clients&#8217; safety. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the initial days when the lockdown was announced, many companies have faced various sorts of issues while managing to work from home (WFH). Even still few of the organizations are facing the same problems at the stretch of remote team management.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Challenges to Manage a Remote Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A remote team is a group of experts from different time zones, distinct skills, and different cultures working unitedly on a unified project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, all small, moderate, big enterprises are focusing on adopting remote working as this is beneficial for current and upcoming time. </span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the survey, it has been found that <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>82%</strong> of </span>respondents said that they experience less stress.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Harvard Business Review</a></strong>, <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>87%</strong></span> of respondents feel more connected via remote working.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the team works from the office, then it requires less management effort as a comparison to remote working. While managing the remote team, many challenges come across, and some of the <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/5-strategies-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">remote team management </a></strong>challenges are related to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the Top Communication Tool</li>
<li>Hiring the Correct Resources</li>
<li>Lacking Accountability Program</li>
<li>Noticing Everyone&#8217;s Time</li>
<li>Unclear Roles and Tasks</li>
<li>Lack of Schedule</li>
<li>Unmanageable Employee Tracking</li>
<li>Lack of Conversation within the Team</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Is The Biggest Advantage of Remote Working?</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1111309/biggest-benefits-to-working-remotely-worldwide/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Statista </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated that in 2020, 32% of respondents said that flexibility is one of the most significant benefits of remote working. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility not only helps employees, but it also benefits the organizations now you might be thinking how?</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, when the employees are given work flexibility, then they try to complete and deliver the task on time, and this finally increases business productivity.</span></p>

<h2><strong>7 Significant and Efficient Ways To Manage Remote Team</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at some point, working virtually is useful then similarly, it also has few drawbacks like it requires perfect remote team management.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the employee of the company will be productive, then only you will be able to boost the business growth, but for that, it is indispensable to manage the <strong><a href="https://www.workstatus.io/blog/workforce-management/remote-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">remote working</a></strong> properly. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should do a proper module to manage the remote team and work. I have mentioned a few ways that will help you to manage the remote team. </span></p>
<ol style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><strong>Make Use Of Modern Technologies</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Proper Checkment On Punch In and Punch-Out</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Don&#8217;t Let Communication Gap Hamper your Productivity</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Make Sure that Your Team Is Satisfied</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus On Final Result Not on Activity</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arrange Proper Resources</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Offer Flexibility</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Proper Record On Punch In and Punch-Out</strong><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13767 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2.jpg" alt="Punch in &amp; Punch out" width="500" height="300" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2.jpg 500w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you are managing the remote team, then suggest them to make proper punch in and punch out. If you are a team leader, then you should daily check the employees punch in and punch out. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing that does not end here means if in case the employee forgets to make a punch in and punch out then as a leader you should once ask the employee why he/she doesn&#8217;t mark the check-in or check out.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the new member has joined the team, then the management team should accurately provide them guidance related to check-in and check out. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage this process in a proper manner you can also forward a gentle reminder associated with the same task, and for doing this, you can build a group on Skype, Zoom, Google&#8217;s Team Hangouts.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Make Use Of Modern Technologies for remote team management</strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage the <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/dedicated-development-teams?utm_source=remote_team_al&amp;utm_medium=remote_team_wblog&amp;utm_campaign=SME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">remote team</a> </strong>in a good manner, you should keep your team connected, and for this, you can use various communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to make everyone engaged.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On using modern technologies, your team will also be able to explore and learn new technological features. There are numerous tasks like tracking, communicating that can be done quickly while making use of advanced technologies.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Coronavirus pandemic, several companies preferred the custom software for managing and tracking their employee&#8217;s work. This mainly helped team leaders and management as it saved the working time and also allowed them to focus on other important work. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If in case you are also looking forward to developing the custom software for your making remote team management easier, then connect with the leading <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">software outsourcing company</a></strong>. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Don’t Bring Communication Gap &#8211; Stay Connected</strong></h3>
<p><b></b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13768 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3.png" alt="dedicated teams" width="512" height="318" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arranging formal or informal meetings with the team will help you all to get connected. While working remotely, there are so many issues that are faced by the employees, try to fix those issues &amp; queries on video or voice call.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, voice and video call facilities are available mostly on all apps like Skype, Zoom so for arranging the meeting you can use such apps. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling is the best way to interact with the team, and this also helps the team to connect with the leaders directly. So pic your phone or video call rather than emailing.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to communicate on the video call; this will help you in recognizing employee expression, and to know whether the employee and clients are interested in the talk or not.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Make Sure that Your Team Is Satisfied</strong></h3>
<p>Being out of sight, you may address problems in knowing the needs of every employee. But try to understand the same by recognizing the clues given by the employees.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get an effective outcome from the team, leaders should try to fulfill the requirements of the team. If the employee is satisfied, then he/she will only be able to provide an effective result. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase the workflow as a team leader, you should know from which situation the employee is going through.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an employee is encountering any sort of issues that can be resolved from your side, then try to fix the same. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In remote working, employees face various problems like internet issues, lack of communication, etc this can be resolved by providing great IT support, and as a result, you get exceptional remote team management.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Focus On Final Result Not on Activity</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the team is working remotely then focus on the employee&#8217;s work, which means you need to check whether the employee&#8217;s work is productive or not! whether he/she is submitting tasks on time or not! Try not to focus on the activity of the remote employees; it is not possible to trace or track all work activity.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think if employees are completing their tasks on time and offering you valuable work, then its activity hardly matters for the organization. You can also encourage the team members; this will boost team performance.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Arrange Proper Resources</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All employees that work in the organization don&#8217;t have proper working setup (laptop, internet connectivity) back at home. So, as a team leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to arrange the assets for the employees. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the COVID-19 pandemic, many employees faced and even facing issues related to working stations, laptops, active internet, etc. If in case your team members are also confronting the same problem then you should adequately guide him/her to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also connect your team members with the IT team to resolve the technical glitches; this will save your time and will also fix the employee concerning issues faster. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a new member has joined the team then as a team leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to make sure that whether the software and other necessary tools have been correctly installed on the employee work station or not.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Offer Flexibility</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13769 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4.png" alt="Remote Team Management" width="460" height="300" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4.png 460w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your team is working remotely, then the company should offer flexibility to the employees, this magnifies the employees work performance and also helps them to deliver the task on time. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are offering flexibility to the employees then as a team leader, you should observe employees&#8217; total working hours.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major drawback of work from home (WFH) is that along with working remotely, you need to manage other tasks also and that this somewhere affects the employee work who are not given the flexibility.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Top 10+ Tools For Effective Remote Team Management</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13770 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team5.jpg" alt="dedicated teams" width="877" height="391" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team5.jpg 1254w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team5-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team5-1024x456.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team5-768x342.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 877px) 100vw, 877px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>38% of small businesses currently outsource a business process.  This percentage is set to increase as we are about to move into 2023. There is a multitude of reasons which you can find online on why you should outsource your business development needs to a custom software development company.</p>
<p>Outsourcing custom software development to the right vendor can significantly reduce development costs and decrease the workload on your employees.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a great number of advantages, there are some significant pitfalls that businesses often make while outsourcing, which can result in failures, additional costs, and time loss.</span></p>
<h2>Five Things to Avoid When Outsourcing Software Development:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1.Lack of Comprehensive Research</strong></h3>
<p>Selecting a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=custom_13052_a24&amp;utm_campaign=SME" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">Custom Software Development Company</a> without conducive research is one of the major pitfalls that businesses make. Most startups base their outsourcing decision solely on the basis of cost-efficiency.</p>
<p>Although the cost factor plays an important role in the decision-making process, it is not the only one. Other things that must be taken into consideration include &#8211; a company’s portfolio, and expertise, feedback and reviews, and the way your outsourcing partner functions on the market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple of areas that you should research to make sure that you have aligned the right outsourcing partner for your next project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll have to dig into the intricate details to know everything that you would like to know such as:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13143 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3.jpg" alt="Questions to ask before Software Outsourcing" width="794" height="514" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3.jpg 794w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /></p>
<p>Principally, a lot of research should be done at the time of the primary interview. The rest will come from real-time communication with your Offshore <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>IT Outsourcing Company</strong></a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, after a thorough and detailed analysis, it becomes much easier to identify whether that team can realize your project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should make up time for research and preparation as its worth it. The time that you have spent on research should be in correlation with the investment size and expected cooperation support that you would like to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your research intricate will depend on your project requirements like for a simple project, you must not invest more than 3-4 months while choosing your next software development company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you need to scale your technical team from 40 to 70 or you have a 3-year roadmap, then you should take your time and do the proper research.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3><b>2. Keeping Ambiguity in Requirements and Miscommunication</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times, small business owners outsource their software development projects without a complete understanding of what needs to be done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, if you have just a vague idea about your project, it becomes quite difficult to set clear requirements for the outsourcing partner, as well as to evaluate whether the process is headed in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few questions that can help you clarify the requirements of your project:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13139 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4.jpg" alt="Requirements for Software Outsourcing" width="794" height="444" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4.jpg 794w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4-768x429.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4-600x336.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, before initiating a collaboration you must discuss the milestones and the approval system as well. Your outsourcing vendor must understand exactly what you want in order to find the most effective ways to implement your idea.</span></p>

<h3><b>3. Outsourcing to Companies that are NOT in Sync with Modern Trends and Updates</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing to outdated companies that are not in sync with modern trends can impose troubles in the longer run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it may seem that you have chosen a</span> web development company<b><i>, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">who can code better than anyone else, they may be using workflows and interfaces specific to their local area. This can cause a significant drift with how end-users will experience your software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No region is worse than others, but it is necessary to check that your outsourcing partner meets your expectations on issues beyond technicalities &#8211; such as legal &amp; compliance risks, working ethics, cultural differences, broadband capacity.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Lack of Basic Tech Expertise at your End</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although outsourcing companies have technical expertise, it doesn’t mean that you presuppose that everything is well aligned at the end of your project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, regular monitoring is important. Lack of technical knowledge at your end may impose some major risks on the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are not in a position to manage projects on your own on a daily basis, then you need to have an internal person or a project manager who can manage and take a consultative approach towards your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opting for such a partner releases you from the pressure of being on your toes with technological upgrades and implementations and also gives you the benefit of leveraging the latest technology for your projects.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. Underestimating the Essence of Quality Assurance or Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing your project while it’s underway is vital for gaining a guarantee that your final project is strong and functions just the way it should. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a tester should be involved in the development process from the very beginning, otherwise, you are likely to encounter tons of bugs in the end. So, ensure that your software is tested appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you’re building, software testing should be an integral part of your software development process from the very beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality Assurance should ideally be done by the same company that collaborates with you for your development projects.</span></p>

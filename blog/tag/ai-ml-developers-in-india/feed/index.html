<p><span style="color: #05164d;"><b>1. Execute an AI Strategy Aligned to Business Goals</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by identifying your top 3-5 business priorities where AI could drive tangible impact &#8211; improving customer retention, reducing operational costs, accelerating research, or any other goal. Conduct an opportunity assessment to map relevant AI use cases to each priority area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, evaluate your organizational readiness across data, infrastructure, and skill sets. Outline short and long-term objectives spanning ~18-24 months aligned to your overarching corporate vision.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="color: #05164d;"><b>2. Build an Enterprise Data Foundation</b></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies are under immense pressure to optimize costs in today&#8217;s highly competitive business landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is slashing expenses in a haphazard manner the smartest approach? What if emerging technologies could enable more strategic cost reduction that even improves operations?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generative AI &#8211; one of the most transformational innovations shaping organizations today. With its extraordinary ability to generate new ideas and insights, this advanced artificial intelligence unlocks game-changing benefits across the enterprise.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How exactly does Generative AI drive cost savings?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generative AI plays a pivotal role when it comes to cost reduction strategies. By automating complex tasks and decision-making processes, it streamlines operations, leading to increased efficiency and resource optimization. </span></p>

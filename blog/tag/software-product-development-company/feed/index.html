<p><b>Reduces time-to-market: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT staff augmentation is an invaluable tool for businesses. It allows them to bring in highly experienced professionals for short periods to help meet tight deadlines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bolsters productivity and fortifies the software product development company&#8217;s good standing for timely outcomes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><b>Facilitates skill gap:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is not uncommon for organizations to encounter skill gaps within their teams in the ever-evolving tech landscape. IT staff augmentation allows businesses to bridge these gaps by hiring experts with specialized skills tailored to their project requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ensures that your team has the expertise to tackle complex challenges and deliver innovative solutions.    </span></p>
<p><b>Hiring flexibility:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IT staff augmentation stands out due to its adaptability. Companies employ skilled individuals temporarily or permanently, depending on their current projects. This lets businesses customize their team size to meet their needs, granting them the capacity to address the tasks in front of them.</span></p>
<p><b>Knowledge Transfer:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When organizations engage with augmented staff, they not only benefit from immediate access to specialized talent but also gain knowledge transfer. Augmented professionals bring fresh perspectives, industry insights, and valuable experiences from their previous engagements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This knowledge sharing can lead to developing more robust and forward-thinking new-gen products and upskilling internal employees working alongside the augmented staff.</span></p>
<p><b>Cost-effectiveness:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Staff augmentation offers a cost-effective solution for businesses. Compared to the expenses associated with recruitment, onboarding, and maintaining permanent employees, staff augmentation is a more efficient option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies can save on recruitment costs, employee benefits, and overhead expenses, as they only pay for the specific skills and resources they need during a project.</span></p>

<p><b>Establishing Clear Communication &amp; Collaboration Channels</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficient communication and cooperation pathways are fundamental for an effective staff augmentation process. Regular meetings and reviews should be implemented to guarantee everyone is aligned with the project and to resolve any troubles or worries rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing this helps prevent confusion and ensures the external and in-house teams aim for the same objectives.</span></p>
<p><b>Setting Expectations &amp; Defining Project Milestones</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing realistic objectives and breaking them into measurable stages is essential to ensure the success of staff augmentation initiative. It is critical to set clear goals, a timeline for the task, and precise results and checkpoints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing this guarantees that everyone focuses on the same goals and that progress toward completion is tracked accurately.</span></p>
<p><b>Ensuring Cultural Alignment with Augmented Team Members</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing a culture fit is a key component of effective staff augmentation. It is imperative to guarantee that all external personnel exhibits a similar work ethic and beliefs as the core staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, their approach to resolving issues and making choices must harmonize with the internal team. This ensures that the two teams unify and focus on a common goal.</span></p>
<p><b>Managing Security &amp; Intellectual Property Concerns</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring the safety of sensitive data and preserving intellectual property is paramount for effective staff augmentation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations should set out precise protocols to prevent potential security incidents, guard against intellectual property theft, and ensure that all team members understand and follow these directives.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern-day tech is changing humankind&#8217;s lifestyle incessantly, and spending time on different software solutions has become an everyday routine of people in the 21st century. It is impossible to imagine any everyday activity, especially at the workplace, without any computer-related process.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we look in-depth, software product development is the major process in the arena that is defined as a precise procedure, inclusive of different strict steps known as the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/software-product-development-life-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software Development Life Cycle</a>. If you need a sophisticated application system (either web or mobile app), you look forward to this process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely, you would have several questions and confusions pertaining to SDLC and its processes. Thus, we will take a comprehensive look at the software product development process in this article. </span></p>
<h2><b>Decoding Software Product Development Process</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/stages-in-software-product-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software product development process</a> is a term defined as collective steps needed to develop a software product from its initial stage to market presence. Typically, it consists of a number of phases in the complex process of delivering a new product and transforming an old product notion into a marketable solution. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-27579 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z.png" alt="image 2022 11 17T12 14 04 506Z" width="1627" height="665" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z.png 1627w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z-300x123.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z-1024x419.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z-768x314.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z-1536x628.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1627px) 100vw, 1627px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is all about the rules and practices that assist in connecting tech, non-tech teams, and project stakeholders in bringing ideas into digital products or software solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process starts from ideation and concludes with product features, pricing strategy, and distribution strategy. In the beginning, the processes hover around the area and market. Although the product development process aims to maximize the product value and mitigate the risk, failure occurred due to poor quality, noncompetitive pricing, retard and premature entry, weak promotion, and bad brand awareness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, now you would have understood what the software product development process is. Let&#8217;s take an in-depth glance into the processes it consists of.</span></p>

<h2><b>Step By Step Software Product Development Processes </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software development process is an amalgamation of different processes, and each has its own significance that empowers the complete process with different attributes and insights. Owing to that, many businesses consider </span>product development consulting<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do everything right in step by step order. So, let&#8217;s take a glance at the step-by-step processes included in software <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/startup-product-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">product development for startups</a>.</span></p>
<h3><b>#1. Brainstorming The Ideas &amp; Planning </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brainstorming is the initial stage of this cycle, where we define the concept for the product. First, it begins with a great idea that you need to carefully think over in order to implement. Besides, the processes can also be termed as idea generation, as we think of every step or stage of the product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact is that a business generates a number of ideas, and a handful is good. The process may include : </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussing the project value and idea with the development team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather information from the market or go through the market statistical occurrence </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describing the concept and idea on a document and sought <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/request-approval-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">approval of stakeholders</a> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you brainstorm over all the ideas and decide the one to implement, It&#8217;s time for planning. Meticulous planning is one core phase of software development. It determines the scope of the project and defines means that can meet strategic business objectives. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20650" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC.png" alt="" width="902" height="528" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC.png 902w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC-300x176.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://www.scnsoft.com/blog/software-project-planning" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, planning also includes considering resource availability &amp; allocation, cost determination and budgeting, timeframe, and determining solutions. Once the perfect plan is determined, you are ready to move forward. Although having a detailed plan is another perk that can turn out very fruitful. </span></p>
<h3><b>#2. Product Research &amp; Requirement Analysis </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is critical to have the right product concept in your mind. If you miss out on this, you can fail to validate your idea first and then end up losing precious time in re-considering. Product research and validation enable you to ensure that you are going to develop a product that users will like to pay for, and you won&#8217;t be wasting time or money. Here are the ways you can conduct product research to validate your idea. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduct an online survey to get feedback </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin a crowdfunding campaign </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking for feedback on forums like Quora or Reddit </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researching in the demand </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this phase, you would be able to define the project in detail and analyze the feasibility. During this process, you need to gather a deeper understanding of the project goal and collect all requirements.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20651" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfgdf.png" alt="" width="566" height="294" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfgdf.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfgdf-300x156.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">product development engineer</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carry out the feasibility analysis that allows them to consider all technical and economic aspects and impacts on the development process, time, resources, tasks, team members, and calculating ROI is majorly defined in the feasibility analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although requirement analysis assists in identifying risks in the beginning stage, it helps identify the risk mitigation strategies that can be implemented from the beginning. </span></p>
<h3><b>#3. Prototyping &amp; Design </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prototyping is the process of creating the preliminary product to test the design of the product and validate the idea. It enables product developers to cater a solution to stakeholders, which can be used for marketing purposes. Once you develop a prototype, your product starts taking a form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After prototyping comes the design of the product, where the actual conceptualization of the solution happens. In design, the detailed software architecture gets developed to meet specific project requirements. The custom-tailored software design helps in defining workflow and standards. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20652" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vxcvzc.png" alt="(Design Principles In Software Development" width="766" height="517" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vxcvzc.png 766w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vxcvzc-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Design Principles In Software Development)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/principles-of-software-design/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, it encompasses overall solution design along with the database. In this phase, the complete product is developed as a mockup or prototype for the next stage of </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=website-20648-productdev-process&amp;utm_medium=d7&amp;utm_campaign=website-20648-productdev-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>custom software development</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From features of the solution to defining hardware and software components are inclusive. </span></p>
<h3><b>#4. Development &amp; Coding </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the designing has been done, now comes development, which majorly includes code writing and transforming design documents into an actual software project. It is the lengthiest cycle of a software development project, as being the backbone of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole process relies on this and a vital thing to pay attention to. The work of the software engineering team is that its code meets the software requirement specification and matches the stakeholder&#8217;s requirement. However, the previous stage of software is fulfilled carefully then a ready-to-use software is bound to match the needs. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-21279" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfddfdf-1.png" alt="" width="566" height="294" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this phase, the software release cycle takes place in three stages, including alpha, beta, release to actual product. </span></p>
<h3><b>#5. Integration &amp; Testing </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when the software is developed, then comes the next phase involving system testing and integration. The process can vary due to the testing processes. But Typically, QA engineers leverage a wide range of frameworks along with integration executing unit tests, automation compilation, and manual testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QA team performs a number of tests, including functional testing, interoperability, system integration, and acceptance testing, etc., in order to ensure that code is clean and the business goals of the solution are met. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, validation and verification are critical aspects of </span>software product development services<b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">ensuring the application/solution is completed successfully. When the software turns into a bug-free solution, deployment starts.</span></p>

<h3><b>#6. Implementation and Deployment </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the process where actual thing-installation happens of the solution. It is a retrospective process after the implementation plan. In this phase, the newly developed and tested application goes forwards to the production stage with the inclusion of data and component transfer. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20654" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfdff.png" alt=" Implementation and Deployment" width="626" height="225" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfdff.png 551w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfdff-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the specific changes will be deployed during the release. Moreover, it can be a straightforward release depending on the complexity of the project. After this, system analysts and end-users can actually try the ready-made application. </span></p>
<h3><b>#7. Operations &amp; Maintenance </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now comes the final stage, where the software development life cycle includes maintenance and regular updates. The phase is regarded as of utmost importance as you collect the real-world feedback and tweak the solution in order to polish it, enhance, and upgrade the fine-tuned solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this phase, the performance gets looked at, and an upgrade takes place to modify the solution according to need and performance aspects. The actual need of the end-user and new capabilities are met by additional user requirements. </span></p>
<h2><b>Wrapping Up </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, the software development processes vary from company to company depending on the aim, such as delivering the best quality product that satisfies the need of product demand. Moreover, customer demand is the major aspect targeted during the processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The processes of </span>product development engineering<span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be shaped and altered depending on the need of each particular project, such as app development, a software provider to identify precise action, and the particular goals achieved. At the same time, the process declaration is a foundation measure to arrange the model for defining frameworks and equip team members in both technical and non-technical works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the quality of code and solution in general, the expectation needs to meet the project manager&#8217;s decision-making progress and more. In the end, the final product is all that matters. Relevant software development processes can help in meeting the customer&#8217;s expectations and by well-tailored and great software solutions that meet business needs and offer exceptional customer satisfaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, SDLC helps programmers to stay on top and keep complete information of the project, while the management team can focus on determining the ways to the timely and efficient delivery of software. Moreover, if you have a </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/dedicated-development-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">dedicated development team</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then you can be a step ahead in software engineering and achieve great results. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has ideas. But do we realize how difficult thriving, workable products or services? Indeed, a hard nut to crack. You need to be innovative while still delivering worth a penny.</p>
<p>According to McKinsey Global Institute data, only 1 out of 7 ideas result in a successful product, and the failure rates for newly launched products are between 25%-45%. Using a structured approach, you’ll stand a greater chance of avoiding any pitfalls resulting in your new product’s failure.</p>
<p>As said by late Apple founder Steve Jobs: “People are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”</p>
<p>But that does not guarantee that the new product will sell like hotcakes. You need to invest time with good command of customer &amp; market needs, your competitors, and offering products with clear value to beat the odds.</p>
<p><strong>This is where the 7 Stages Of Product Development Help:</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20074 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839.png" alt=" Stages Of Product Development " width="2048" height="368" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839.png 2048w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-300x54.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-1024x184.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-768x138.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-1536x276.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involving customers at the early stage helps NPD process and understand their problem before executing ideas into process, tools, and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Necessity leads to invention. That’s where the New Product development Process(NDP) will help. A very simplified process to convert ideas into a tested concept into viable products and eliminate non-feasible ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where the </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/stages-of-new-product-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">new product development process (</a></strong>NDP<strong>)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes into play. This process is designed to aid the conversion of new and untested concepts into viable products and market them while allowing you to weed out non-feasible ideas.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Is New Product Development?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New product development is all about converting an idea into a business-strategic workable software development product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Product Development (NPD) process involves researching existing products in the market with a customer-centric approach, feasibility of the idea, delivering working software and latching on the market opportunities, and delivering working software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product development is an umbrella term that covers six stages of SDLC and working and has a POC. The</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Product Development</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">approach revolves around an entirely new idea, where the uncertainty around its development and the next option remains high. Software</span> product development companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">are progressively exploring NPD facets to address development glitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is about releasing the latest software product, you should seek services from leading </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software product development services</a><b>;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then, always a fair <strong>idea</strong> to join hands with leading firms.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 1: Idea Generation</b></h2>
<p><strong>Emphasize On Customer Problems: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good entrepreneur can scan the issues faced by the target audiences.  You can always identify the issues the customer is facing.</span></p>
<h3><strong>a) Personal Roadblocks</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or a buyer, the customer&#8217;s tendency always remains the same. All you need to do is prioritize one problem, derive a solution, and tag it” one for all. If you’re looking to set the tone right before product development, subscribing to </span>product design and development companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">could help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to apply your brain behind digital offerings. The communication gap often leads to many problems&#8212;&#8211; and is the biggest hurdle towards the path to productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a product and launching it can have some ups and downs, but there should focus on making up a great business idea.</span></p>
<h3><b>b) </b><b>Qualify Each Of The Listed Problems</b></h3>
<p><b>Here is the 4 U strategy:</b></p>
<p>Let’s discuss each of these aspects in detail.</p>
<p><b>Unworkable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out whether the brainstormed product concepts will address some real problems. Will the product be able to fill the existing customer experience gaps and will achieve product-market fit?</span></p>
<p><b>Unavoidable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the problem that you are working on inevitable to the extent that it becomes mandatory to comply? You need to find out whether solving that problem is a choice or a compulsion.</span></p>
<p><b>Urgent:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is the problem urgent and is highly demandable by the target market? If the answer is affirmative, this could be your chance to cover the white space in the market with your original product.</span></p>
<p><b>Underserved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there no available products that address the existing user problems? Look for the whitespace in the market and hold on to the idea that looks promising.</span></p>
<h3><b>c) </b><b>Emerging With Possible Solutions </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the problem gets figured out, you can start looking for possible solutions with a </span>product development firm <span style="font-weight: 400;">to produce feasible solutions. For every new user problem, there’ll be a new NPD service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have figured out the problem, it’s time to look for possible solutions. For every user problem, there ought to be potential new product development opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the workflow that starts from a problem and ends up with strategizing around the solution.</span></p>
<h3><b>d) Narrowing Down The Problems</b></h3>
<p>Categorize all shortlisted problems using a comparison chart with solutions<b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Circulate the findings across the organizational structure to come up with a viable problem set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case stakeholders are reserved, you can Replicate, Re-purpose, and with an upgrade approach.</span></p>
<p><b>Replicate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  You can create a similar product with. a competitor and launch it in the new market conditions. Once MVP(Minimum Viable Product) is launched, then you should prioritize out-of-the-box features.</span></p>
<p><b>Re-Purpose</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  You can rewire the existing business model and present it in the most viable manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It focuses on rewiring an existing business model—for instance, LinkedIn Learning &amp; e-learning platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Upgrading: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This concept of NPD revolves around the existing model with some improvements. Be it performance, speed, or addressing challenges of competitors with added functionalities. </span></p>

<hr />
<h2><b>Stage 2: Idea Screening</b><b>      </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new product development stage is about choosing the idea that gives you the highest potential for success. You can put all your ideas collectively for internal review, i.e., seek the advice of people with industry knowledge and experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When developing a new product idea, leverage the advantage of POC (Proof of Concept) to check the feasibility of the concept. One can’t zero on an idea that is not technically feasible to build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can consult the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/on-demand-teams/why-startups-choose-dedicated-teams-for-agile-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Agile development teams</a>&#8212;&#8211;expertise helps understand the technical side of things and helps shortlist ideas worth building a PoC. In India, </span>software product development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> leading-age technology solutions give the prospects a smooth development experience</span></p>
<p><b>SWOT (</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities &amp; Threats</span><b>) </b>is prevalent and good practice while shortlisting New Product development ideas.</p>
<p>The agile development team, product owner, scrum master, and product manager go through a detailed analysis and shortlist ideas&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; opportunities and strengths, threats picture and weaknesses.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a SWOT is relatively simple, and you need a simple 2×2 grid to get started:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWOT Analysis Template | New Product Development</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, your New Product Development idea should be unique so that you do not have to convince people to pay for it.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 3: Concept Development &amp; Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluation of value proposition is the first step towards testing and development. It ensures you assess the problem in advance and can course-correct earlier. It saves from piling new technical debts.</span></p>
<p><b>These steps easy-to-follow steps include :</b></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantifying gain/pain Ratio</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a competitor analysis </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enlisting major product features</span></li>

<h2><b>Stage 4: Value Proposition Strategy </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great asset of </span>product development companies in India <span style="font-weight: 400;">before they launch any product. You should be very particular about the capabilities of new products. Once you are good to go with the idea’s utility, you can pitch it clearly to the end-user. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It ensures that a product or service positions around customer exact values and needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the form of a </span>value proposition<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can showcase what your product is capable of doing.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20135" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.png" alt=" value proposition" width="566" height="276" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.png 850w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4-300x146.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4-768x374.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<h2><b>Stage 5:Concept Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are ready with the proposition in </span>software product development<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can now present it to the set of selected customers. The key is to have trust and belief in your ideas. Since the concept doesn’t look promising, you’ll repeat steps to develop a new project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get meaningful insight by focusing on four critical aspects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identification of the focus group, i.e., people who would benefit from the new product under development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessment of other alternatives to be offered to the focus group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Devising a foolproof plan for the New Product Development right from features, marketing, pricing, and distribution</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integration of unique product features into the customer’s mind for findability and discoverability.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Stage 6: Product Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span>product development software companies<span style="font-weight: 400;"> start, execution of ideas occurs, the business strategy is documented &#8212;- you can go ahead with the product development cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Product Development starts with developing the prototype followed by MVP.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Prototype</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creation of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/product-ui-ux-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">UI/UX of the product</a> and share with the stakeholders helps visualize the product’s feasibility in the marketplace.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</b></h3>
<p>Using Agile for the new products gives a different look.  Once the product goes through the design &amp; steps &#8212; the product gets launched with minimal features.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile Product development is better than conventional. The waterfall model complements the to-and-fro movement across the development cycle and ideal for last-time changes.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 7: Market Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps in New Product Development aims to reduce the uncertainty revolving around the </span>software product development<span style="font-weight: 400;">, i.e., checking the viability of the new product or its marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>There are two market testing strategies to follow:</b></p>
<h3><b>1. Alpha Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of testing allows testing engineers to judge any product based on performance and map the marketing mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of any issues, the changes are planned and implemented before the final go-ahead.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Beta Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selected group of customers gives unbiased feedback to the organization. It is all about listening to customers’ voices when issuing a move back to the development team for fixtures.</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s how Alpha and Beta testing are different from each other:</b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20139" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf.png" alt="" width="513" height="471" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf.png 750w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /></p>
<p>The third form of testing conveyed product validation and is called In-Home Usage Test (IIHUT). Development products are meant for intended customers who will use the products.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These steps will help you with not just the development but also with ERP system architecture or integration. So, let’s find out: </span></p>
<p><b>1. Initial Planning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: First, you must begin with a comprehensive assessment of your organization&#8217;s needs and objectives. Identify pain points, inefficiencies, and opportunities that the custom ERP system will address.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Development Approach</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: You must decide whether in-house development or <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-outsourcing-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software outsourcing services</a> align best with your resources and expertise. Each has its merits and considerations.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Design and Development</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A balance of design and development is crucial for successful ERP software development. Collaborate closely with <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">skilled developers</a> and designers to create a blueprint encapsulating your vision. Focus on user interface design, functionality, and scalability.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Testing and Quality Assurance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Rigorous testing ensures your custom ERP system operates flawlessly. From functionality checks to security audits, this phase is paramount.</span></p>
<p><b>5. Deployment and User Training</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Roll out your custom ERP system gradually to minimize disruptions. Provide comprehensive training to users to maximize adoption and ROI.</span></p>

<p><b>10. Cost Considerations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Track and manage custom ERP costs throughout development, including initial investments and long-term operational expenses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s look at the critical aspects you should consider when evaluating the costs of your  tailored ERP development: </span></p>
<p><b>#1. Initial Development Costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Start by estimating the upfront costs, which include <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software development</a>, customization, hardware procurement, and consulting fees. Ensure you have a detailed breakdown of these expenses.</span></p>
<p><b>#2. License and Subscription Fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Factor in ERP software licensing fees and ongoing subscription costs. Some ERP solutions charge on a per-user common challenges.</span></p>
<p><b>#3. Implementation Costs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Beyond software costs, you should also consider expenses related to the implementation process, such as data migration, integration with existing systems, and employee training.</span></p>
<p><b>#4. Maintenance and Support</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Budget for ongoing maintenance and support, which may include software updates, troubleshooting, and helpdesk services. These are essential for system longevity.</span></p>
<p><b>#5. Infrastructure and Hardware:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Assess your hardware requirements, including servers, networking equipment, and storage devices. Ensure your infrastructure can support the ERP system effectively.</span></p>
<p><b>#6. Customization Expenses:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tailoring your ERP system to your needs may incur additional development costs. Account for these customization expenses.</span></p>
<p><b>#7. User Licenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Determine the number of user licenses needed and calculate the associated costs. Some ERP solutions charge based on concurrent users or named users.</span></p>
<p><b>#8. Consulting and Professional Services:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you enlist external consultants or experts, allocate a budget for their services, which can be invaluable for project guidance and risk mitigation.</span></p>
<p><b>#9. Training Costs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Training employees to use the new ERP system is crucial. Consider expenses related to training materials, trainers, and the time employees spend away from their regular tasks. To avoid this cost, you can <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-software-developers-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire the top 1% of software developers</a> across the globe who have expertise in ERP software customization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#<strong>1</strong></span><b>0. Contingency Budget:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&#8217;s wise to have a contingency fund to address unexpected costs that may arise during the ERP implementation.</span></p>
<p><b>#11. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculate the TCO over the expected lifespan of your ERP system, factoring in all ongoing expenses, to understand the true cost over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of the ERP system development process may vary from business to business however, these key points will lead you in the right direction. </span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Insufficient Planning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Rushing into ERP development without a well-defined plan can misalign your business needs.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Scope Creep</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Beware of scope creep, where the project gradually expands beyond the initial scope.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Inadequate User Involvement:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> User input is invaluable. Failing to involve end-users in the design and testing phases can result in an ERP system that doesn&#8217;t meet their needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Poor Data Management</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Neglecting data migration and quality can disrupt operations. Ensure meticulous data cleansing and migration strategies are in place.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Overlooking Change Management</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Employees need support adapting to the new system. Neglecting change management can lead to resistance and reduced adoption rates.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Not Evaluating ROI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Regularly measure the return on investment (ROI) to ensure the ERP system delivers the expected benefits and justifies the investment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Underestimating Training Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Adequate user training is essential for system adoption. Allocate sufficient time and resources for comprehensive training programs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lack of Contingency Planning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Not preparing for contingencies can leave you vulnerable to unexpected issues. Build a contingency plan to address potential roadblocks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ignoring Regulatory Compliance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Industries like healthcare and finance have specific regulations. Neglecting compliance can result in legal consequences and operational disruptions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Neglecting Post-Launch Support:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The project isn&#8217;t over at launch. Plan ongoing support and maintenance to address issues and optimize the system.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Overlooking Scalability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ensure your ERP system can scale with your business. Failing to consider scalability can lead to costly system replacements down the line.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the whole globe. During this pandemic, most of the enterprises(small to big) adopted remote working for employees and clients&#8217; safety. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the initial days when the lockdown was announced, many companies have faced various sorts of issues while managing to work from home (WFH). Even still few of the organizations are facing the same problems at the stretch of remote team management.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Challenges to Manage a Remote Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A remote team is a group of experts from different time zones, distinct skills, and different cultures working unitedly on a unified project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, all small, moderate, big enterprises are focusing on adopting remote working as this is beneficial for current and upcoming time. </span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the survey, it has been found that <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>82%</strong> of </span>respondents said that they experience less stress.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Harvard Business Review</a></strong>, <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>87%</strong></span> of respondents feel more connected via remote working.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the team works from the office, then it requires less management effort as a comparison to remote working. While managing the remote team, many challenges come across, and some of the <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/5-strategies-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">remote team management </a></strong>challenges are related to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the Top Communication Tool</li>
<li>Hiring the Correct Resources</li>
<li>Lacking Accountability Program</li>
<li>Noticing Everyone&#8217;s Time</li>
<li>Unclear Roles and Tasks</li>
<li>Lack of Schedule</li>
<li>Unmanageable Employee Tracking</li>
<li>Lack of Conversation within the Team</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Is The Biggest Advantage of Remote Working?</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1111309/biggest-benefits-to-working-remotely-worldwide/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Statista </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated that in 2020, 32% of respondents said that flexibility is one of the most significant benefits of remote working. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility not only helps employees, but it also benefits the organizations now you might be thinking how?</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, when the employees are given work flexibility, then they try to complete and deliver the task on time, and this finally increases business productivity.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing that does not end here means if in case the employee forgets to make a punch in and punch out then as a leader you should once ask the employee why he/she doesn&#8217;t mark the check-in or check out.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the new member has joined the team, then the management team should accurately provide them guidance related to check-in and check out. </span></p>

There are numerous tasks like tracking, communicating that can be done quickly while making use of advanced technologies.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, voice and video call facilities are available mostly on all apps like Skype, Zoom so for arranging the meeting you can use such apps. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling is the best way to interact with the team, and this also helps the team to connect with the leaders directly. So pic your phone or video call rather than emailing.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to communicate on the video call; this will help you in recognizing employee expression, and to know whether the employee and clients are interested in the talk or not.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Make Sure that Your Team Is Satisfied</strong></h3>
<p>Being out of sight, you may address problems in knowing the needs of every employee. But try to understand the same by recognizing the clues given by the employees.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get an effective outcome from the team, leaders should try to fulfill the requirements of the team. If the employee is satisfied, then he/she will only be able to provide an effective result. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase the workflow as a team leader, you should know from which situation the employee is going through.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an employee is encountering any sort of issues that can be resolved from your side, then try to fix the same. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In remote working, employees face various problems like internet issues, lack of communication, etc this can be resolved by providing great IT support, and as a result, you get exceptional remote team management.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Focus On Final Result Not on Activity</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the team is working remotely then focus on the employee&#8217;s work, which means you need to check whether the employee&#8217;s work is productive or not! whether he/she is submitting tasks on time or not! Try not to focus on the activity of the remote employees; it is not possible to trace or track all work activity.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think if employees are completing their tasks on time and offering you valuable work, then its activity hardly matters for the organization. You can also encourage the team members; this will boost team performance.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Arrange Proper Resources</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All employees that work in the organization don&#8217;t have proper working setup (laptop, internet connectivity) back at home. So, as a team leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to arrange the assets for the employees. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the COVID-19 pandemic, many employees faced and even facing issues related to working stations, laptops, active internet, etc. If in case your team members are also confronting the same problem then you should adequately guide him/her to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also connect your team members with the IT team to resolve the technical glitches; this will save your time and will also fix the employee concerning issues faster. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a new member has joined the team then as a team leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to make sure that whether the software and other necessary tools have been correctly installed on the employee work station or not.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Offer Flexibility</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13769 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4.png" alt="Remote Team Management" width="460" height="300" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4.png 460w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your team is working remotely, then the company should offer flexibility to the employees, this magnifies the employees work performance and also helps them to deliver the task on time. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are offering flexibility to the employees then as a team leader, you should observe employees&#8217; total working hours.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major drawback of work from home (WFH) is that along with working remotely, you need to manage other tasks also and that this somewhere affects the employee work who are not given the flexibility.</span></p>

<h3><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Around The Clock Service</span></strong></h3>

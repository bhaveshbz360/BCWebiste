<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Factors To Look For When You Come Up With New SaaS Product Ideas</strong></h2>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1. Find a need and fulfill it</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The best way to develop unique SaaS product ideas is to identify a need in the marketplace and then create a solution for that. There are many ways to go about this, but one of the simplest is to look for problems you have faced in your business. If you can solve your problem, others out there are possibly facing the same problem and are willing to pay for a solution.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2. Think outside the box</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">You need to think outside the box to develop genuinely unique SaaS product ideas. It can be done by looking at the market from a different perspective and coming up with solutions that are not yet being offered. This can be difficult, but it is often worth it as it can lead to a groundbreaking product.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3. Simplify existing solutions</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Many times, the best way to create a unique SaaS product is to take an existing solution and simplify it. Often, products in the market are needlessly complicated and could be made much easier to use. You may have found your niche if you can streamline an existing solution.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are a few more key factors to look for when you come up with new SaaS product ideas.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">First, the product should solve a problem that your target market is facing. It should also be something that they are willing to pay for. Additionally, the product should be unique and differentiated from your competitors.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Another essential factor to consider is whether there is a demand for the product. You can determine this by conducting market research and seeing if there is a niche market for the product. If there is already a lot of competition in the space, it may be challenging to break into the market. However, if there is unmet demand, you may have a better chance .</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Finally, you must ensure that you have the resources and capabilities to develop and launch the product. This includes having a team with the necessary skill sets and enough funding to get the project off the ground. Without these things in place, bringing your SaaS product ideas to life will be challenging.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3" style="text-align: center;">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What are SaaS-based products?</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A SaaS-based product is a software product that is delivered over the internet as a service. It is hosted by the provider and made available to customers over the web. Customers access and use the software, typically through a web browser, while the provider manages the infrastructure and security.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">SaaS products are usually subscription-based, with users paying a monthly or annual fee to access and use the product. This type of pricing model contrasts with traditional software products, which are sold as one-time license fees (often called “perpetual licenses”).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How do I create a SaaS product?</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The best way to create a SaaS product depends on the specific needs of your business and your target customers. However, in general, here are some tips on how to create a successful SaaS product:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">1. Define your target market and understand its needs.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">2. Research and analyze your competitors.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">3. Design a user-friendly interface that is easy to use.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">4. Develop an effective marketing strategy to reach your target market.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">5. Offer customer support and technical assistance to help users with any problems they may encounter.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is Micro SaaS?</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Micro SaaS is a term coined by Salesforce Ventures to describe a new category of cloud-based software products that are smaller in scope and priced lower than traditional enterprise software.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Micro SaaS products are designed for specific business functions, such as sales or marketing, and can be accessed on demand through a web browser or mobile app. They are typically easy to use and can be implemented quickly without the need for custom development or integration.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Because they are smaller in scope, micro SaaS products can be priced significantly lower than traditional enterprise software. And because they are delivered as a service, there are no up-front costs or complex licensing agreements. Customers simply pay for what they use on a monthly basis.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is the difference between cloud and SaaS?</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The fundamental difference between cloud and SaaS is that cloud is a type of infrastructure, while SaaS is a type of software. Cloud enables businesses to provision resources on-demand, such as compute power, storage, and applications. SaaS delivers software applications over the internet to users.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Another way to think about the difference between cloud and SaaS is that the cloud provides the foundation for running applications (including SaaS applications), while SaaS delivers those applications to users. Many people use the terms “cloud” and “SaaS” interchangeably, but they are technically different concepts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, most tech startups, in fact, enterprises have drifted away from developing new software products in-house. But is it right to stop growth in the face of a disaster such as this?</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the novel coronavirus is as big as a problem as it gets. But the world will eventually come out of it. At that time, would you want your startup to take its time to freshen up and understand the needs of the market? Or would you want to start preparing a great software product so you&#8217;re ready when the market needs it most?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure your choice would be the latter, but most businesses have their hands tied. They&#8217;re unable to operate due to lockdowns, disruption in supply chains, unavailability of staff, and out of myriad problems created by COVID-19. Yet, there are few businesses that are fortunately <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/covid-19-are-we-ready-to-face-this-global-adversity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">working as smooth as ever</a>, especially in the software outsourcing sector.</p>
<p>So if a business (maybe yours) is unable to work on an in-house software project due to COVID-19, is it a wise choice to outsource it to an <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">offshore software development company</a>? Why outsourcing is important? What are the benefits of outsourcing a software development project?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, if you&#8217;re a tech startup in desperate need to capitalize on an opportunity and establish a market presence, then:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1- This isn&#8217;t the best time to run your business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2- Once we&#8217;re done with COVID-19, the state of the market at the time will present unprecedented opportunities that startups could capitalize on. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the same time, your startup could be competing with 100s of established enterprises looking to capitalize on the same opportunities.</span></p>
<p>Is there something you could to have an edge over potential competitors in such a scenario?<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong> Product Development Outsourcing</strong></a> could be the masterstroke for a competitive advantage in the long-run. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-3822 size-full aligncenter" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg" alt="outsourcing product development" width="800" height="628" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development-300x236.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you may know, there are multiple options available in the market to build functional software products. However, when it comes to startups, there&#8217;s a conventional line of thought which says that the benefits of outsourcing are for enterprises only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you can certainly outsource product development as a startup and this is important to your business as well, especially in this pandemic situation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Benefits of Outsourcing</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple benefits of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing IT and software development services</a>. let&#8217;s start with cost.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing provides a global talent pool at a low cost. You hire a backend developer (in-house) at  98000 USD/year and it comes down to 22000 USD/year when you outsource.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The risk is lesser</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of new products whose market is yet to be tested, outsourcing plays an important role in mitigating the risks of trying out something new. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Since the outsourced teams work on flexible models the risks are definitely lower.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>It&#8217;s Faster</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing the development helps in faster development with the Agile model and helps in tremendously reducing the time to market. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You may be new to the market. That&#8217;s not an issue until you have technical expertise with you. If you already have that, then it&#8217;s good, however, if you don&#8217;t- then it is better to outsource.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>key steps for your startup to effectively outsource product development</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b><b>Choose the Right Vendor</b></b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right vendor for outsourcing application development is a must. An <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=blog_al&amp;utm_medium=startup_prodev_3816&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing company with expertise</a></strong> in the required development skills will surely be helpful. Picking up freelancers is definitely not advisable, as they cannot be relied upon, for taking up product ownership. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the important points to consider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while selecting a vendor for outsourcing development is the flexibility of hiring models. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps the startup choose a hiring plan that will optimize the costs of outsourcing in accordance with the development requirements. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important to evaluate the portfolio of the hiring vendor to understand the level of specialization in different business verticals.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Defining The Scope Of The Project</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second most important step in outsourcing your product development is to define the scope of the project. First, you need to convert the business idea into a business plan and then put down what all you need from a successful product. Defining the technology with which you wish to develop your product is another crucial decision. This also helps in defining the skill levels of the teams you wish to hire. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the scope of the project is defined and the vendor for product development has been chosen, the service level agreement with the vendor can be created. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps in ensuring that the outsourced teams are working according to the plan of action. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outsourced teams must be clearly communicated about the expectations and the milestones. This helps in developing mutually beneficial relationships with the outsourcing partner.</span></p>

<h3><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Communication</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping in touch with the outsourcing partner on a regular basis and reviewing project work in progress on a constant basis is important. This is helpful in improving project productivity levels. Motivating remote teams with incentives and appreciation is helpful in getting better business results.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overall, a continuous communication helps you to finish tasks smoothly.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>KeyPoints To Build An Amazing Mobile App</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For developing excellent mobile applications, you should first make a mobile app development module, and then after that, you should start working on it. The building process of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">mobile app development</a> will include the following subjects.</span></p>
<h3><strong>1) Idea Analysis</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14034" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/akcelerator-ang.png" alt="" width="675" height="615" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/akcelerator-ang.png 1070w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/akcelerator-ang-300x273.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/akcelerator-ang-1024x932.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/akcelerator-ang-768x699.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the foremost thing that every business owner should consider before starting to build an app, especially when it comes to startups. An idea is something that affects the whole app since it is the base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An idea analysis for app development comprises market analysis, competition analysis, and country-specific research. It is a perfect startup business plan for your app idea.</span></p>
<p><strong>Market Analysis:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Right audience targeting, Unique Selling Proposition(USP), marketing channels are the key essentials of marketing analysis. Targeting the right customers is necessary because customers are the key ingredient for the success of your app. USP is needed to convince someone why your app is superior to other similar apps. Moreover, you can choose different marketing channels as per your target audience to make aware of people about your app.</span></p>
<p><strong>Competition analysis:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Google play store consists of millions of apps, which makes it more competitive and difficult for your app to get a good reputation in less time. Since there are already a number of similar apps, you just need to design and deploy unique features into your app to gain the attention of maximum users. Moreover, you need to choose a sensible monetization strategy to curb this problem.</span></p>
<p><strong>Country-specific research:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is important to research well to identify the needs of different countries and fulfill them via your app. Country-specific research helps <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">app developers</a> design the app as per the requirements of different people across the world. It will let them embed all those features required by different people into the startup&#8217;s mobile app.</span></p>

<h3>2) Planning</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14031" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ux-788002-1920_3.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="438" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ux-788002-1920_3.jpg 667w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ux-788002-1920_3-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good plan, if executed in the right manner, can take your app towards success soon. Your business plan must have a projected <a href="https://www.jotform.com/pdf-templates/profit-and-loss-statement-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">profit and loss statement</a> that establishes the various liabilities and assets that you will accumulate, ideally over a one-year period. Here are some key metrics are given below for the good planning of your startup mobile app.</span></p>
<p><strong>Surveys and Questionnaires:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> By running surveys and questionnaires, you will get unmatched insights about customer behavior that adds some weight to your mobile app business plan. If you know your target audience, it will become easy for you to ask questions about usage patterns.</span></p>
<p><strong>Monetization Strategy:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This strategy helps you to predict the cash flow of a mobile app. Most applications focus on user growth over revenue and monetize the user base much later.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check for Google trends:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Check Google Trends for keywords related to the idea of your application. Ideally, your application points to a problem and a growing market, and Google Trends can give you a fair idea about your potential customers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Use Analytics:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can also use third-party application analytics platforms such as App Annie and Sensor Tower to get more details about the size of the market and understand what you&#8217;re up against.</span></p>
<h3><b>3) Budgeting</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8091" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="429" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing.jpg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with a mobile application for its new startup is very profitable compared to other companies. The mobile application can be built for a price as low as less than $ 2000, compared to a restaurant&#8217;s configuration that requires an investment of $ 50,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the significant budget metrics are given below:</span></p>
<p><strong>Lifetime Value:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This value gives you an idea of how much money you can expect to make on average from a single user. It actually indicates the financial viability of your mobile app.</span></p>
<p><strong>Customer Acquisition Cost:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is a critical metric that gives you an idea of the cost per app install or CPI. For an exact CPI, you need to use some industry benchmarks. Thus, it gives you an idea of how much you can expect to spend as you go after high-value users.</span></p>
<p><strong>Runway and Burn rate:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your burn rate should be low as it determines how much money you need to spend per month. At the same time, the runway is defined as the total funds per burn rate.</span></p>

<h3>4) Outsourcing</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14030" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mobile-apps.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mobile-apps.jpg 950w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mobile-apps-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mobile-apps-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing projects is a good decision for any startup. For startups, it is difficult to invest in hiring in-house companies when they have a low budget. However, hiring a </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=mobile_8089&amp;utm_campaign=SME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>dedicated mobile app developer</strong> </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would not cost much to startups and also provide the perfect mobile app development for their project as they focus on core activities. It is a cost-saving approach with many business benefits for startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire a developer</a>, then he/she will be solely responsible for building the mobile app. It will be their headache to provide you reliable solutions on the basis of the business requirements. Starting from choosing an app UI design to releasing it on Google Play Store or App Store, all will be done by the hired mobile app developer. But for that, you need to choose one of the<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-mobile-app-development-companies-that-innovate-unique-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> best Mobile App Development Companies</a> to hire an Android app developer or iOS app developer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, usually startups, SMEs, and even big enterprises make mistakes in hiring the right developers for their business, and this ultimately offers the fallacious solution to the businesses. If you want to avoid such mistakes, then for once read  </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/mistakes-to-avoid-while-hiring-mobile-app-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 Mistakes to Avoid While Hiring Mobile App Developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this write-up.</span></p>
<h3>5) Mobile App Marketing</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8090" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="312" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing.jpg 1920w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing-600x281.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing-1024x480.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are millions of users of mobile devices and tablets. There is a substantial market for the application. You must define your target audience to whom you will market your mobile application. The narrower the target segment, the higher the conversion rate. It will also help you provide excellent customer experience and greater customer loyalties. Moreover, you can use a wide range of channels to disseminate your marketing messages, depending on your user preferences. </span></p>
<p><b>Some of these channels include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media ads</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retargeting campaigns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organic installs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">App store optimization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile site redirection</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event marketing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push and in-app notifications</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without marketing of an application, the mobile app will not become popular, so to introduce the mobile app in the market, you should take major concern. You can also take help from the social marketing team to make your app popular.</span></p>

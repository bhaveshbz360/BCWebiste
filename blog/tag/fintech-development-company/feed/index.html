<h3><b>#9. Crypto Exchange Platform </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most fruitful and successful app idea for financial startups. The platform helps users to enter the decentralized market of cryptocurrencies and make fund transfers secure &amp; untraceable. But here, cryptocurrency is traded instead of other digital currencies. Transparency, low fees, fast processing, and the highest level of security are the best features of the crypto exchange platform.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19780" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f10.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1148" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f10.png 1600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f10-300x215.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f10-1024x735.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f10-768x551.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f10-1536x1102.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/spot-is-a-cryptocurrency-app-to-control-all-your-wallets-and-exchange-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In selecting any of these ideas, startups need to consider a number of important factors such as compliance requirements, <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/fundraising-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">fundraising platforms</a></strong>, identifying niche markets, <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-cryptocurrency-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire cryptocurrency developers</a> </strong>from a recognized company, and getting information on competitive challenges and apps. After doing enough research, the startup should consult with a mobile app development company to hire experienced developers.</span></p>
<h3><b>#10. Digital wallet</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As digital wallets prevent users from carrying physical wallets or credit/debit cards, their market is also growing significantly. These applications give users the ability to pay in certain taps or use biometrics while getting back coupons and attractive offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital wallet market is estimated to reach $ 7,581.91 bn by 2024. Suffice it to tell you why entrepreneurs choose it among the various innovative ideas of apps to enter the financial market.</span></p>

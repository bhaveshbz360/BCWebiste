This seamless connectivity has also impacted the buying habits of consumers worldwide.

<h2><strong>Need for eCommerce Application Development </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When around <a href="https://whop.com/blog/ecommerce-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow noreferrer" data-wpel-link="exclude">80%</a> of consumers are using their smartphones to make purchases online, the importance of having an eCommerce app cannot be overlooked. Let’s look at the benefits of eCommerce apps that will help you make a better decision.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An eCommerce app benefits both small and new businesses and attracts customers easily</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials, one of the primary segments of online consumers, prefer buying on mobile devices</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce app helps in brand building and better customer service</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving a personalized and more responsive experience attracts more customers. They can shop on the go while traveling, having a meal, or while exercising without the need to carry heavy laptops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s move to the approach a business should take for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ecommerce app development</strong></a> But, before that we will learn the types of eCommerce apps.</span></p>

<h2><strong>eCommerce App Types</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*sgQ6WJ5RYvUeE21G" alt="steps for ecommerce development " width="904" height="314" data-image-id="0*sgQ6WJ5RYvUeE21G" data-width="1440" data-height="500" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.simform.com/blog/steps-for-ecommerce-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-href="https://www.simform.com/blog/steps-for-ecommerce-mobile-app-development/" data-wpel-link="external">Image source</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are mainly four categories of eCommerce apps:</span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Business-to-Business (B2B) eCommerce App</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications that enable businesses to exchange their goods or services via mobile channels are called B2B eCommerce apps. Alibaba is one of the most popular examples of this type of app, wherein retailers can directly connect with manufacturers to purchase a product.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Business-to-Consumer (B2C)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common and widely used application types is a B2C app, which enables a business to sell its product directly to the consumer without the need for a retailer. Amazon is a well-known example of this type of app.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of apps are meant for consumers to exchange their products or services with consumers. OLX is an example of a C2C eCommerce app, wherein buyers and sellers can connect without needing a middleman.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Consumer-to-Business (C2B)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some businesses act as buyers for products and services such as design, content, etc. Upwork and Github are some platforms that connect consumers or professionals with businesses.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Developmental Components of eCommerce App</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business has different goals, and what components should be added depends on those parameters. However, some developmental components of eCommerce apps are common:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Multimedia Content</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An application will have images, videos, texts, graphics, etc to make the user journey seamless and engaging. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Servers</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to have powerful servers that can support large quantities of different types of content. The server should be reliable, robust, and secure at the same time.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Information Exchange</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information exchange in eCommerce apps mainly uses wireless, cable, and telecommunication services. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Device Access</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different users install apps on different devices. For example, some might access Netflix on television, while others will use it on a mobile, laptop, or tablet. Therefore, it is important to consider device access when developing the application.</span></p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">13. One-Page Checkout</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last feature that you should consider adding is a one-page checkout.

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Steps To Follow While Creating An Ecommerce App</strong></h2>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#1. Customer Needs Assessment</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step in ecommerce mobile app development is to identify your customers&#8217; needs. What are your customers looking for in an app? What features would make their shopping experience easier and more enjoyable? Consider these things mindfully as you design your wireframes and storyboards.</span></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">#<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2. Create a design for your app</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you know what your customers want, it’s time to start designing your app. This will involve creating wireframes and storyboards showing how the app looks and functions. Having a solid design before you start coding is important, as this will help ensure a smooth e-commerce application development process.</span></p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#3. Decide Programming Language Stack</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick a programming language that you want to use. Many languages can be used for mobile app development, such as Objective-C, Swift, for iOS apps, and Java for Android. If your business already has a large team of e-commerce developers who know one of these languages, it looks suitable to stick with it so they don’t have to learn anything new.</span></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#4. List of requirements &amp; start coding</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a good design and the language your team will use, it’s time to start coding. You’ll need an API (Application Programming Interface) and a backend so that your app can function and connect to your company’s databases. Make sure you don’t forget about legal issues such as copyright infringement! Your IP attorney should help you find all potential problems before it’s too late.</span></p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#5. Intensive Testing</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most successful apps are those with good reviews, customer feedback, and ratings. You can improve your app’s rating by constantly listening to customer feedback and implementing changes based on what they say. Once your ecommerce development company and you’re confident everything is working as it should be, release your ecommerce app.</span></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#6. Continuous Upgradation For Ecommerce Development</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing an ecommerce app is never really done. There are always new features and updates to consider. Ensure you have a team to handle these tasks so your app remains up-to-date and compliant with all legal requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The steps above provide a general overview of the process of developing an e-commerce app. By following these steps, you can create a successful app that meets your customers&#8217; needs and helps your business grow.</span></p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Wrapping Up</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecommerce apps are the future. If your business is not developing an app for customers, it will soon be left behind in the dust. Keep in mind that building an ecommerce app is never really done.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The last decade has depicted a significant rise in mobile consumption, and the number of smartphone users in 2021 is estimated to surpass 3.8 billion worldwide. Owing to the increasing use of mobile phones for everyday tasks like shopping, food ordering, on-demand service procurement, businesses have to think of developing a mind-blowing mobile strategy to thrive. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">While a plethora of native mobile apps is already available on app stores, progressive web apps are gaining traction significantly. Clearly, progressive web app development services are thriving as a major substitute for native mobile apps. As these apps don&#8217;t need to be downloaded or installed on mobile phones, users are more driven to try these apps. </span></p>
<h2 align="left"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Let&#8217;s take a glance at some PWA statistics describing elevated usage in popularity of PWA.</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The conversion rate of PWA is 36% higher than native apps. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Consumer engagement is recorded 50% more on PWA apps. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Businesses migrating to PWAs have witnessed a 10X decrease in page loading speed. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">PWAs cost 3-4 less in development than a native mobile app. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The cost of maintaining PWA is 33% less.</span></li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Clearly, PWAs are subject to profit in 2021 and beyond. However, the question is how eCommerce is going to acquire benefits from the service of PWAs. Since its arrival in 2015, PWAs have been adopted by a number of eCommerce giants such as Alibaba and Walmart. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Increased conversion rates and revenue growth are the major benefits acquired by these organizations. That&#8217;s the reason both small and medium eCommerce businesses are looking to embrace PWA technology to provide customers with an app-like experience on the website and extend interaction. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Surely, you would be having several questions looming in your head, such as what are PWA? How can they benefit the eCommerce business? And so on. Let&#8217;s find answers.</span></p>

<h2 align="left"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>What are PWAs?</b></span></h2>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is no rocket science behind the progressive web app (PWA). Succinctly, PWAs are website applications at the core that work with the latest web capabilities to deliver a native app-like experience to users. The major perk of these applications is consistency between web and native applications. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Native applications are coveted for delivering a richer user experience than a web application. To mend the gap between native and web applications, the development of Progressive web apps arrived in the market. Overall, PWAs behave like native apps such as: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Steady and Faster Processing</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Smart Home Screen</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Push Notification</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Even Offline Operations</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20813" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfdasfda.png" alt="progressive web apps" width="630" height="398" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfdasfda.png 760w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfdasfda-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">All of these features are extended from native application architecture. Businesses can cater to native-like app experience with web applications by subscribing to PWAs. Moreover, the biggest advantage of creating a PWA is users don&#8217;t need to download and install the app. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">PWAs are readily available on the web and run on browsers. Moreover, you don&#8217;t need to hire developers with some extra coding language experience, as progressive web apps develop via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Moreover, progressive web app developers can also leverage platforms like VuePress and Gatsby that can be connected to eCommerce platforms. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sooner or later, PWAs may replace native apps, as a Jaxenter survey found that 46% of developers assert that PWAs are the future, while 14% think that native mobile apps will prevail. For some eCommerce businesses, native applications can be preferable. However, for small and medium-sized businesses, PWA can be a better choice than native app development. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As PWA technology is expanding and gaining more traction among businesses, it can be a tech for headless commerce configuration, which means decoupling frontend presentation from backend features. Having a PWA front end means simply subscribing to a faster, responsive app-like web experience. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So, do you have some second thoughts regarding what PWAs? Let&#8217;s know more about PWAs role in the eCommerce industry.</span></p>

<h3 align="left"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>PWA Is A Lucky Stone In The ECommerce Business Landscape&#8230;&#8230;</b></span></h3>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20818" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdffg.png" alt="" width="658" height="390" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdffg.png 2048w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdffg-300x178.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdffg-1024x607.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdffg-768x455.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdffg-1536x911.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nobody can deny that PWAs are incredibly significant in the eCommerce market presently. Actually, JavaScript and web technology infrastructure reduce the cost of PWA eCommerce application development. Besides, the native-like app experience inspires users to visit the application again and again. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As I mentioned above, the customer engagement and conversion rate is higher on PWAs than on the native app. This is all because of fast, secure, reliable, and browser-agnostic properties. Besides, these apps are created in a small fraction of the time and cost it takes to develop a native mobile application. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Furthermore, PWAs are revolutionary in the eCommerce industry. Here are few interesting facts that show how significant are PWAs in eCommerce </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pinterest recreated its website into a PWA that resulted in 40% surged user browsing time. Besides, the revenue surpassed the bar of 44% through user-generated ads and 60% from core engagement. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">BookMyShow also adopted PWA that resulted in an 80% increase in conversion rate. Although PWAs are 54X smaller than the Android app and 180X smaller than the iOS application. Moreover, the loading time is comparatively less, just 2.94 seconds.</span></p>

</ul>

<h2 align="left"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How Can PWAs Empower Your ECommerce Business In 2021?</strong></span></h2>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">These days, most of the traffic in eCommerce websites comes mostly from mobile devices. Thus, it is crucial for merchants to offer the best shopping experience on mobile to engage with the audience. As mobile traffic is increasing over almost all major platforms, mobile traffic still makes up 16% of total conversion. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Per Google reports, as eCommerce stores are switching to progressive web apps, there is a 20% boost in overall revenue and 2X more conversion rate. Surely, you must be wondering why you should consider PWA <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-development-services?utm_source=web-pwa-ecom-20809&amp;utm_medium=web-pwa-ecom-20809" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">eCommerce website development</a>. Let&#8217;s know how PWA can boost your eCommerce business growth. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b><span style="font-size: 14pt;">#1. Better Customer Acquisition</span> </b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You already know that progressive web apps provide a highly engaging user experience by employing web capabilities as native apps. Progressive web apps can also be installed on the home screen so that users can easily access them. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The progressive web app can be downloaded with a simple web link and accepting a prompt. If we understand in a simple word, the website will transform into a web app, and a browser shortcut will be placed on the home screen. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It means when a user visits a website, the progressive app will get installed on the mobile, and further, no updates are needed. PWAs update in the background with the assurance that users will use the most recent content. This all turns out very effective and results in more customers on the platform. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20822" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdafdf.png" alt="PWA add to home screen" width="612" height="365" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdafdf.png 2048w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdafdf-300x179.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdafdf-1024x610.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdafdf-768x458.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afdafdf-1536x915.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></span></p>
<pre style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://medium.com/progressivewebapps/how-to-install-a-pwa-to-your-device-68a8d37fadc1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><u>Image source </u></a></span></pre>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Businesses are already reporting that people are installing PWAs and not giving much preference to native apps. Flipkart witnessed a 60% decline in its native app download as users switched to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/progressivewebapps/case-studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><u>Flipkart PWA.</u></a> For small and medium-sized businesses, creating PWA can be a strategy to acquire more customers on the website. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For user adoption, quick installs with PWAs can result in more engagement and success. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>#2 Increased User Engagement With Push Notification </b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Push notification is a significant feature of the native application. But! Now it can be implemented in web apps labeling under PWAs. And! Push notifications are more intuitive in progressive web apps and enable businesses to reach their target audience innovatively and directly. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The feature creates a highly engaging customer experience, as small messages leave a huge impact and grab instant attention. Although eCommerce businesses are leveraging email marketing for years, push notifications seem to replace the practice as they offer bigger advantages over email marketing.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20823" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afadfadf.png" alt="PWA push notification" width="569" height="427" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afadfadf.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afadfadf-300x225.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/afadfadf-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" /></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Push notification directly appears on a person&#8217;s phone and stands out uniquely. Besides, eCommerce businesses don&#8217;t need to employ a great effort to send notifications in place of preparing a complete strategy for email marketing. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In short, eCommerce businesses can promote their products and services in a more convenient way and share information about deals and discounts faster.</span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>#3. Decrease cost of development and time </b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">These days eCommerce businesses are adopting the omnichannel, multiplatform strategy and enthusiastically building, promoting, and maintaining their platform for systems including (responsive) website, Android, and iOS. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Before hiring <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-web-app-developers?utm_source=web-pwa-ecom-20809&amp;utm_medium=web-pwa-ecom-20809" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>web app developers</b></a>, you need to know that building, optimizing, and maintaining a website or native mobile app is already a resource-intensive task and requires a full-fledged team of app and website developers. Moreover, these processes also require a great length of time to accomplish processes. </span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With Progressive apps, you don&#8217;t need to develop, maintain and market a platform except for the PWA website. This offers a special chance to serve all channels from one stage, which is constructed, kept up, and overhauled by one group. It decreases expenses and time-to-advertise radically while as yet serving a similar client experience and capacities to all clients and keeping the multi-channel technique.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>#4. Instant and Excellent Performance</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Progressive Web Apps are configuration-built for amazingly smooth and quick user encounters. You can exploit the speed, as it is a major advantage of the web apps and &#8216;native style&#8217; customer side caching; it performs incredibly both on page loads. PWAs can stack(load) inside only 1 second, making a genuine instant experience, connecting with the users directly from the beginning.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Also, Progressive Web Apps are utilizing fundamentally less disk space – on the server and the users&#8217; gadget – giving advantages, for example, quicker load times, less information utilization, and less <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/web-app-for-storage-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">required extra storage</a>.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20824" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dafdfdfd.png" alt="customer retention between PWA and Native App" width="682" height="461" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dafdfdfd.png 1480w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dafdfdfd-300x203.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dafdfdfd-1024x692.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dafdfdfd-768x519.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></span></p>

The PWA is 54× more modest than an Android application and 180× more modest than an iOS application.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>#5. Web optimization Compatibility</b></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since a PWA is online, everything is discoverable via web search tools. Any substance inside a PWA can be connected to, shared, and positioned by Google and Bing. This contrasts with native applications, which don&#8217;t permit creep via web search engine robots. By separating the obstructions among web and native, users can straightforwardly connect to the most modern items, on any gadget, whenever.</span></p>

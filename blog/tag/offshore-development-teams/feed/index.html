<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Offshoring Right eCommerce Development Team </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand that having </span>eCommerce app development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not enough; you must also be well-skilled in managing offshore teams. Make sure you have a good understanding of </span>how to manage software development teams <span style="font-weight: 400;">and get the job done. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s discuss some of the right ways to </span>offshore development teams<span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business. </span></em></p>
<h2><strong> Identify Your Requirements</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses must focus on their requirements when </span>outsourcing software development<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to avoid setbacks. To make the right decision, businesses should clearly understand the type of team they need and the required skills. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a business developing an ecommerce website should look for the best companies. A </span>software development company in India <span style="font-weight: 400;">can offer you the expertise in creating robust ecommerce solutions at a reasonable cost. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30743 aligncenter" title="How To Identify The Requirements For eCommerce Development 1" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-To-Identify-The-Requirements-For-eCommerce-Development-1.jpg" alt="How To Identify The Requirements For eCommerce Development 1" width="800" height="788" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-To-Identify-The-Requirements-For-eCommerce-Development-1.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-To-Identify-The-Requirements-For-eCommerce-Development-1-300x296.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/How-To-Identify-The-Requirements-For-eCommerce-Development-1-768x756.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team should also have experience integrating advanced payment gateways and features like SEO-friendly page structure, third-party integrations, and more. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By prioritizing their requirements, businesses can ensure that the chosen offshore ecommerce development team can deliver a high-quality product that meets their specific needs.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ensuring The Right Fit  </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is finding the right </span>offshore dedicated development team<span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business that understands your vision like you and actively works on the business goals. This can be done by clearly outlining the project requirements &amp; objectives. It includes the technology stack and language, budget, timeline, etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the experience &amp; expertise of the </span>offshore team<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in similar projects, their communication style, and their track record of success. It&#8217;s always a good idea to ask for references from former clients or customers to understand how reliable and successful the offshore team is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, test their skills before signing contracts to ensure they are the right fit. This could include having them complete a coding challenge or other assessment to evaluate their knowledge and abilities. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking these steps, you can be sure that you have chosen the right offshore partner for your eCommerce project and that they have the skills &amp; expertise necessary to deliver a great project.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Define Roles &amp; Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When hiring an </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-development-services?utm_source=Web_blog%2830248%29&amp;utm_medium=Anu_B11&amp;utm_id=eCommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">offshore eCommerce app development company</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business, defining each team member&#8217;s roles &amp; responsibilities is essential. Doing this will help ensure they complete the project on time and to the highest standards. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, it helps in stating clearly what each</span> offshore team<span style="font-weight: 400;"> member is responsible for and makes them accountable for achieving them. This can help avoid any confusion or misunderstandings. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following are some typical roles &amp; responsibilities that need to be assigned: </span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Project Manager:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  A project manager manages your eCommerce development project. They oversee the budget, timeline, and deliverables and ensure the progress of your project as planned.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Developers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  A developer is the backbone of an </span>eCommerce development project <span style="font-weight: 400;">which not only writes the code but also implements the technical aspects of the project. They work closely with the technical lead to ensure the code is high quality and meets the project requirements.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>UX/UI Designer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The UX/UI designer will be responsible for the design &amp; user experience of your eCommerce website. They play a significant role in </span>eCommerce app development services <span style="font-weight: 400;">by creating attractive and engaging UX/UI designs for the website. Also, they are the ones who work closely with the technical lead and developers to implement the design correctly.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> QA analysts are responsible for ensuring the quality of the eCommerce website. They test the website for bugs, errors, and usability issues and work closely with the developers to resolve any problems. There are many types of QA analysts, so it depends on your project requirements.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Technical Lead:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Technical team is incomplete without its leader, so you would also need a technical lead for your project. A technical lead handles the technical aspects of the project. They ensure that the team follows the best practices and standards and oversees the eCommerce website&#8217;s design, development, and testing.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Business Analyst:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While your tech team will be working on your <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/ecommerce-cms/top-5-ecommerce-platforms-to-launch-online-store-rocket-up-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">eCommerce platform</a>, you will require a business analyst who can convey all the requirements to them. A business analyst understands the business requirements &amp; translates them into technical specifications. They work closely with the project manager, technical lead, and developers to ensure the eCommerce website meets the business requirements.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Support Team:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A support team provides ongoing support &amp; maintenance for the eCommerce website. They ensure the website runs smoothly and addresses any issues arising after the launch. They are always available when for any challenges.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can ensure they develop the eCommerce website efficiently and effectively by assigning the right roles and responsibilities. Hence, offshoring your eCommerce development team requires a clear definition and allocation of roles and responsibilities.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Establish Effective Communication</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining good communication with an </span>offshore team<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is crucial for successfully managing a software development project. Regular meetings with the development team, setting clear expectations and guidelines, and establishing suitable communication protocols help ensure efficiency and quality of work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By having consistent and open communication, businesses can track progress and promptly address any issues. It also allows the offshore team to provide feedback and suggestions, ultimately leading to a better end product. Good communication can also help build trust and foster a positive working relationship between the business and the offshore team.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30744 aligncenter" title="VCA3 T1150" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VCA3-T1150.jpg" alt="VCA3 T1150" width="1200" height="1057" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VCA3-T1150.jpg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VCA3-T1150-300x264.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VCA3-T1150-1024x902.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/VCA3-T1150-768x676.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of regular meetings, you can participate in progress discussions, expectations, and challenges. You can set clear guidelines and expectations that will help. Doing this will help keep the development team focused and productive. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the best ways you can establish effective communication with your offshore team: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Utilize multiple communication channels:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can use a combination of communication channels like instant messaging, email, video conferencing, project management tools, and mobile applications to keep in touch with the offshore team.</span></li>
<li><b>Establish clear communication protocol: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define your communication protocols so the </span>offshore development team<span style="font-weight: 400;"> can understand your project’s goals and expectations. Suitable communication protocols ensure everyone agrees regarding deadlines, issues, or other matters.</span></li>
<li><b>Provide precise project requirements:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Provide clear project requirements &amp; instructions to the offshore team, like technical specifications, design guidelines, and project timelines. This will help them meet the project goals and your expectations. </span></li>
<li><b>Set clear expectations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Clear communication of expectations between both parties is good to avoid any future hurdles; this includes communication frequency, availability, and response time.  </span></li>
<li><b>Assign a project manager</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: For better communication, you can assign a project manager who will act as a liaison between <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/cost-comparison-offshore-vs-onshore-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">onshore and offshore teams</a> and ensure effective communication.</span></li>
<li><b>Foster a positive work culture: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage a positive one that promotes open communication, collaboration, and teamwork. This is one of the essential parts of effective team communication. </span></li>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Encouraging Collaboration</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a thriving eCommerce development project, a collaboration between your offshore &amp; in-house teams is essential. It ensures a successful outcome and reduces the potential for errors or misunderstandings. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing your </span><b>offshore teams</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriately by sharing clear feedback to help them improvise and deliver what you expect. It is also beneficial to encourage your development teams to have access to the same resources as your in-house teams. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will enable them to keep updated with changes, provide input on improvements, and collaborate on solutions more effectively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at the same time, giving your offshore development teams the freedom to work autonomously is essential.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>38% of small businesses currently outsource a business process.  This percentage is set to increase as we are about to move into 2023. There is a multitude of reasons which you can find online on why you should outsource your business development needs to a custom software development company.</p>
<p>Outsourcing custom software development to the right vendor can significantly reduce development costs and decrease the workload on your employees.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a great number of advantages, there are some significant pitfalls that businesses often make while outsourcing, which can result in failures, additional costs, and time loss.</span></p>
<h2>Five Things to Avoid When Outsourcing Software Development:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1.Lack of Comprehensive Research</strong></h3>
<p>Selecting a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=custom_13052_a24&amp;utm_campaign=SME" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">Custom Software Development Company</a> without conducive research is one of the major pitfalls that businesses make. Most startups base their outsourcing decision solely on the basis of cost-efficiency.</p>
<p>Although the cost factor plays an important role in the decision-making process, it is not the only one. Other things that must be taken into consideration include &#8211; a company’s portfolio, and expertise, feedback and reviews, and the way your outsourcing partner functions on the market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple of areas that you should research to make sure that you have aligned the right outsourcing partner for your next project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll have to dig into the intricate details to know everything that you would like to know such as:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13143 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3.jpg" alt="Questions to ask before Software Outsourcing" width="794" height="514" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3.jpg 794w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /></p>
<p>Principally, a lot of research should be done at the time of the primary interview. The rest will come from real-time communication with your Offshore <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>IT Outsourcing Company</strong></a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, after a thorough and detailed analysis, it becomes much easier to identify whether that team can realize your project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should make up time for research and preparation as its worth it. The time that you have spent on research should be in correlation with the investment size and expected cooperation support that you would like to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your research intricate will depend on your project requirements like for a simple project, you must not invest more than 3-4 months while choosing your next software development company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you need to scale your technical team from 40 to 70 or you have a 3-year roadmap, then you should take your time and do the proper research.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3><b>2. Keeping Ambiguity in Requirements and Miscommunication</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times, small business owners outsource their software development projects without a complete understanding of what needs to be done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, if you have just a vague idea about your project, it becomes quite difficult to set clear requirements for the outsourcing partner, as well as to evaluate whether the process is headed in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few questions that can help you clarify the requirements of your project:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13139 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4.jpg" alt="Requirements for Software Outsourcing" width="794" height="444" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4.jpg 794w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4-768x429.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4-600x336.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, before initiating a collaboration you must discuss the milestones and the approval system as well. Your outsourcing vendor must understand exactly what you want in order to find the most effective ways to implement your idea.</span></p>

<h3><b>3. Outsourcing to Companies that are NOT in Sync with Modern Trends and Updates</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing to outdated companies that are not in sync with modern trends can impose troubles in the longer run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it may seem that you have chosen a</span> web development company<b><i>, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">who can code better than anyone else, they may be using workflows and interfaces specific to their local area. This can cause a significant drift with how end-users will experience your software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No region is worse than others, but it is necessary to check that your outsourcing partner meets your expectations on issues beyond technicalities &#8211; such as legal &amp; compliance risks, working ethics, cultural differences, broadband capacity.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Lack of Basic Tech Expertise at your End</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although outsourcing companies have technical expertise, it doesn’t mean that you presuppose that everything is well aligned at the end of your project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, regular monitoring is important. Lack of technical knowledge at your end may impose some major risks on the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are not in a position to manage projects on your own on a daily basis, then you need to have an internal person or a project manager who can manage and take a consultative approach towards your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opting for such a partner releases you from the pressure of being on your toes with technological upgrades and implementations and also gives you the benefit of leveraging the latest technology for your projects.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. Underestimating the Essence of Quality Assurance or Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing your project while it’s underway is vital for gaining a guarantee that your final project is strong and functions just the way it should. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a tester should be involved in the development process from the very beginning, otherwise, you are likely to encounter tons of bugs in the end. So, ensure that your software is tested appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you’re building, software testing should be an integral part of your software development process from the very beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality Assurance should ideally be done by the same company that collaborates with you for your development projects.</span></p>

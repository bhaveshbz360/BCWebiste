<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With software development outsourcing, you don’t have to pay for the extra staff, equipment, and software that would typically be necessary to complete a project in-house. Furthermore, you can outsource the project to a provider specializing in the software development you need, ensuring the best outcome at a lower cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By outsourcing the project, you can also benefit from economies of scale, as you can benefit from the provider’s existing infrastructure, tools, and processes. Therefore, if you are looking for a cost-effective way to develop software, outsourcing makes the best resource.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, software development outsourcing is also a great way to access a larger talent pool due to its cost-effectiveness. By hiring an outsourcing company, you don’t have to pay for training and other related costs that come with hiring a permanent employee. This helps you save money while still getting access to the best possible talent. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce these risks, entering into a clear and specific contract is advisable before commencing any project. This agreement should outline the various roles and responsibilities for all involved and define the desired expectations for each party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, by researching and carefully selecting an experienced software development outsourcing provider, you can guarantee the project&#8217;s success and ensure that the best decision is made for your business.</span></p>
<h3>Management Issues</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT outsourcing can be challenging because you rely on another company to handle a critical part of your business. Some ways to mitigate this risk include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Do your research: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your research should include proper references, reliable reviews, and get a sense of the track record of potential outsourcing partners.</span></li>
<li><b> Be clear about expectations: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you contact a software outsourcing company, you need to be clear about your expectations. </span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are you looking for, and by when? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What quality standards should be met? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate all of this upfront to avoid misunderstandings later on.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><b> Have a contingency plan:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If things go wrong, you must have a contingency plan. </span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will you do if the outsourced work is not up to par? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will you handle delays? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a plan will help you react quickly and effectively in the event of any problems.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3>Issues with Communication</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might face a few key communication issues when outsourcing your blog content creation.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Language barrier</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If you&#8217;re outsourcing to a country where English is not the first language, there may be communication issues. Keep your instructions clear and concise, you can also use a tool like Google Translate to help with language barriers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Time zone difference</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If you outsource to someone in a different time zone, coordinating schedules and communicating in real time becomes difficult. You should share your expectations upfront; you can also use tools like Skype or email to stay in touch.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cultural differences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: What might be considered acceptable or professional in one culture might not be in another. Maintain clear and concise communication to avoid any misunderstandings.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Maintaining Quality</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few key challenges you might face when outsourcing your work. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Quality Control</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When you’re not overseeing the work yourself, ensuring that the quality standards can be challenging. Therefore, handpicking a vendor with a proven track record of delivering high-quality work is essential.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Managing Expectations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When you outsource, you’re essentially handing over control of a project to someone else. Setting clear expectations is essential to avoid unpleasant surprises.</span></li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re not working side-by-side with your team, keeping everyone on the same page can be challenging. Effective communication is critical to ensure everyone is on track and meeting deadlines.</span></li>

<h3><b>Cost-Effective Solutions</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is sometimes difficult to maintain the cost-effectiveness of the options. The challenges that come across are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Type of Work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Outsourcing some types of work is costlier than others. For example, complex engineering tasks or jobs requiring specialist skills may be more expensive to outsource than relatively simple manufacturing tasks.</span></li>
<li><b>Supplier Location</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Wages and other costs can vary significantly between different countries, so it is essential to consider this when sourcing suppliers. For example, suppliers in developing countries may offer lower rates than those in developed countries.</span></li>
<li><b>Size and Scale of the Project</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The cost of outsourcing can increase with the project&#8217;s size and scale due to improved coordination costs and communication costs.</span></li>
<li><b>Level of Service Required:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The necessary level of service from the supplier will also impact costs. For example, if you need a high level of customer support or wrapper services, this will generally cost more than if you only require essential supplier services.</span></li>

<h3><strong>All Tasks Cannot Be Outsourced</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some specific tasks cannot be outsourced. These tasks require a high level of personal interaction or customization, time-sensitive tasks, and a high degree of knowledge about your company and products.</span></p>
<p><b>Some examples of tasks that cannot be outsourced include:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Sales: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling is a highly personal process requiring a deep understanding of your product and customer. It&#8217;s also a process heavily reliant on relationships &#8211; something difficult to replicate when outsourcing.</span></li>
<li><b> Customization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have products or services that need to be customized for each customer, it will be tough to outsource this process. This customization requires close interaction with the customer to understand their specific needs.</span></li>
<li><b> Time-Sensitive Tasks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some tasks simply cannot be rushed. For example, if you&#8217;re launching a new product, you must ensure all the details are perfect before it goes live. Running this process could result in serious mistakes being made.</span></li>
<li><b> Highly Knowledge-Intensive Tasks:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some tasks require in-depth knowledge of your company and products to complete correctly. For example, if you&#8217;re writing marketing copy, you need to understand what makes your product unique and how to position it in the market. This task is difficult to outsource because it requires intimate knowledge of your business.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, most tech startups, in fact, enterprises have drifted away from developing new software products in-house. But is it right to stop growth in the face of a disaster such as this?</p>

At that time, would you want your startup to take its time to freshen up and understand the needs of the market? Or would you want to start preparing a great software product so you&#8217;re ready when the market needs it most?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure your choice would be the latter, but most businesses have their hands tied. They&#8217;re unable to operate due to lockdowns, disruption in supply chains, unavailability of staff, and out of myriad problems created by COVID-19. Yet, there are few businesses that are fortunately <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/covid-19-are-we-ready-to-face-this-global-adversity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">working as smooth as ever</a>, especially in the software outsourcing sector.</p>
<p>So if a business (maybe yours) is unable to work on an in-house software project due to COVID-19, is it a wise choice to outsource it to an <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">offshore software development company</a>? Why outsourcing is important? What are the benefits of outsourcing a software development project?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1- This isn&#8217;t the best time to run your business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2- Once we&#8217;re done with COVID-19, the state of the market at the time will present unprecedented opportunities that startups could capitalize on. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the same time, your startup could be competing with 100s of established enterprises looking to capitalize on the same opportunities.</span></p>
<p>Is there something you could to have an edge over potential competitors in such a scenario?<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong> Product Development Outsourcing</strong></a> could be the masterstroke for a competitive advantage in the long-run.

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>key steps for your startup to effectively outsource product development</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b><b>Choose the Right Vendor</b></b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right vendor for outsourcing application development is a must. An <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=blog_al&amp;utm_medium=startup_prodev_3816&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing company with expertise</a></strong> in the required development skills will surely be helpful. Picking up freelancers is definitely not advisable, as they cannot be relied upon, for taking up product ownership. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the important points to consider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while selecting a vendor for outsourcing development is the flexibility of hiring models. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps the startup choose a hiring plan that will optimize the costs of outsourcing in accordance with the development requirements. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important to evaluate the portfolio of the hiring vendor to understand the level of specialization in different business verticals.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Defining The Scope Of The Project</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second most important step in outsourcing your product development is to define the scope of the project. First, you need to convert the business idea into a business plan and then put down what all you need from a successful product. Defining the technology with which you wish to develop your product is another crucial decision. This also helps in defining the skill levels of the teams you wish to hire. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the scope of the project is defined and the vendor for product development has been chosen, the service level agreement with the vendor can be created. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps in ensuring that the outsourced teams are working according to the plan of action. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outsourced teams must be clearly communicated about the expectations and the milestones. This helps in developing mutually beneficial relationships with the outsourcing partner.</span></p>

<h3><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Communication</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping in touch with the outsourcing partner on a regular basis and reviewing project work in progress on a constant basis is important. This is helpful in improving project productivity levels. Motivating remote teams with incentives and appreciation is helpful in getting better business results.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overall, a continuous communication helps you to finish tasks smoothly.</strong></p>

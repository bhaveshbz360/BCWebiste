										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">With <strong>1 million</strong> surplus skilled tech workers and an endless supply of new graduates, <strong>India</strong> is quickly becoming the go-to country for technology leaders around the world.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Even<strong> Jeff Bezos</strong> said that the <strong>21st century</strong> would be the <strong>Indian century</strong> as the technological advancements would be immense.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/667/0*Yxy3rMqzBh4Iq6aB" data-image-id="0*Yxy3rMqzBh4Iq6aB" data-width="1600" data-height="978" /></figure>
<h2 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why India?</strong></span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Currently, most companies are struggling with talent shortages due to automation or other factors like education affordability; Indian citizens provide enough quality coders without breaking your bank account!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">The current talent crunch is forcing companies in every industry to look elsewhere for their outsourcing requirements. And, it seems like India will become the leader of technology with its rising economy!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, many organizations realize that their IT teams can’t handle the workload alone and need help from an outside source.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Software development outsourcing has become increasingly popular because it not only saves money. Besides, it also increases productivity by freeing up time for other important tasks in business operations like sales or marketing efforts.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">This allows companies to grow more quickly without investing heavily into new technologies, which could be expensive upfront costs (especially if they don’t work).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">However, before you decide to <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">outsource IT services In India</strong></a>, you must know why India is the best choice for your project development.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Let’s understand the top reasons to pick India for IT outsourcing-</span></h2>
<p><iframe title="India Is Top IT Outsourcing Destination In 2022! Everything You Must Know" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtTQI7qChxE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Top Reasons To Pick India For IT Outsourcing:</strong></h3>
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#1. Low Development Cost</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">The cost of developing software can vary from country to country, but it’s not just about the amount you pay. It’s also about quality. <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Indian app developers</a> provide the best quality solutions &amp; innovation at the most affordable price.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">The US industry currently has an average price tag of around $70k-100K for simple apps and websites, while developers in India charge as little as 40%. Moreover, in India, the cost of living is lower than in America.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/667/0*dTg56uyxY_tTT8Ow" data-image-id="0*dTg56uyxY_tTT8Ow" data-width="1024" data-height="768" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">It means Indian people earn less money but enjoy a higher standard of living thanks to low prices for goods and services that are still affordable by most citizens. Therefore, you can afford to outsource software development projects.</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#2. Skilled &amp; Trained Developers</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">India has a humongous pool of experienced and talented web &amp; app developers. With 200000 software graduates entering the industry every year, it is no surprise that India’s IT sector employs one-third more skilled workers than China does!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">An overwhelming majority (89%) hold at least bachelor’s degrees in computer science or engineering from Indian universities. Altogether, they learn courses on everything related to coding, including JavaScript programming languages.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the demand for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-software-developers-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software developers</a> is surging every year, and India has plenty to offer. The Indian tech industry employs millions of people with advanced knowledge in technology.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/667/0*WUPaq6C19zJyNpD_" data-image-id="0*WUPaq6C19zJyNpD_" data-width="1200" data-height="887" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">It helps them build perfect applications from scratch or improve existing ones through remote working sessions abroad.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">When a software development company outsources to India, the developers not only provide the best services but also show their skills in managing projects and designing.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, Indian engineers are keen on completing tasks within a timeline by performing high-quality testing throughout the application’s lifecycle.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#3. On-Time Work Completion</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">India can provide 24/7 round-the-clock software development services to global clients. It will enhance productivity by keeping projects going even when it’s nighttime or weekend time in countries like America.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Just think how much faster we’ll get things done! Altogether, the overlapping period could also be utilized as an opportunity for developers to meet up with colleagues working from other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">This way, one company here may complete multiple tasks simultaneously while another works during off-peak periods such as morning.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, it is an amazing opportunity for businesses to finish their project within the given deadline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Also Read:</strong></span> <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/reasons-why-small-businesses-should-consider-it-outsourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Reasons Why Small Businesses Should Consider IT Outsourcing</a></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#4. No Communication Barrier</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">India has billions of non-native English speakers, the largest in the world. It is very seamless for USA clients to communicate &amp; share the vision with a Software development outsourcing company in India, especially since they speak 5th most fluently!</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/667/0*ciL4EfH9JNWFqlI0" data-image-id="0*ciL4EfH9JNWFqlI0" data-width="725" data-height="561" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.peerbits.com/blog/why-indian-developers-best-for-outsourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-href="https://www.peerbits.com/blog/why-indian-developers-best-for-outsourcing.html" data-wpel-link="external">Image source</a></span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Top developers there utilize various tools like Skype and Slack too so that communication goes smoothly between parties involved.” Thus, you can communicate with them easily, share essential ideas, and discuss issues in detail without facing any hassle.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#5. Reduced Time</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">You can’t rush excellence. But you also don’t want to extend the project timeline by waiting for perfection either!</em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">I’ve seen projects take weeks or months because their In-house developers were too afraid of making mistakes. It only leaves them with no time leftover from your initial deadline estimate just so everything could be polished off “perfectly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services?utm_source=Soft_Pro_Dev&amp;utm_medium=Web_Blog&amp;utm_campaign=outsource+to+India&amp;utm_id=NKY_23711" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Outsourcing software development services in India</strong></a> is the best option for anyone who needs a quick turnaround time or doesn’t have enough resources at their disposal.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">That’s because these companies are well aware of how important it can be when you’re under pressure. It means they’ll take care not only about hiring skilled employees but also giving them all the necessary training so that your business runs smoothly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, hiring an in-house team for this task would be extremely difficult. The HR department needs time to find and hire the right people, which can take months — including orientation training necessary on top of it all!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">This means your deadline will slip past if you don’t outsource software development overseas. Outsourcing software development is a hassle-free solution for any company that has too many resources but not enough time.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">By outsourcing to an efficient team, you can focus on more challenging projects and leave your internal developers free from extra work that doesn’t benefit them or company productivity at all!</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#6. Improved Quality</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">The lack of dedicated attention to development and testing might be affecting more than just the speed at which you’re able to deliver new features.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the quality will also suffer if these two processes (testing &amp; development) can’t work in tandem with one another. Besides, developers may add bugs without knowing about them until users start reporting unexpected behaviors on your site or app.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Altogether, there’s no guarantee that this would fix anything because not all problems have quick solutions! When you outsource your software development, you do get more time spent on each task.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/667/0*wwer2NpafB8Y-j9X" data-image-id="0*wwer2NpafB8Y-j9X" data-width="1028" data-height="611" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.altexsoft.com/whitepapers/quality-assurance-quality-control-and-testing-the-basics-of-software-quality-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-href="https://www.altexsoft.com/whitepapers/quality-assurance-quality-control-and-testing-the-basics-of-software-quality-management/" data-wpel-link="external">Image source</a></span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">It improves productivity and the quality of the solution. Moreover, Outsourcing software development to India not only saves you time and money but also boosts your team’s productivity.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">The availability of resources like dedicated teams for both testing as well as coding ensures that there are enough people with knowledge in their specific field.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">They can help out in case any problems arise during the process, which further improves quality control before launching anything into the production environment or marketplace.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the experience of an outsourcing team working on a diverse range of projects will improve output. Altogether, they are able to think more creatively because they have seen it all before. It results in higher quality products for you!</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#7. Consolidated Security</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">With an outsourced team of highly skilled professionals, you can have peace of mind that your software product is being developed and maintained by experts. Your business will be able to focus on other important aspects such as promotions.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, IT outsourcing companies take care of all the tedious tasks like testing for potential vulnerabilities or implementing security features into its development process as per industry best practices.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">In short, you can ensure that solution you are creating has enough safety &amp; security features to prevent data theft.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have already decided to outsource your project and are wondering <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/why-india?utm_source=Why_india&amp;utm_medium=Web_Blog&amp;utm_campaign=outsource+to+India&amp;utm_id=NKY_23711" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Why India</a> and how to outsource to India?. Don’t bother yourself; let’s take a glance at the guide to outsourcing IT projects to India.</span></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How To Outsource Your IT Project To India?</strong></h3>
<figure class="graf graf--figure" style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/667/0*vgWlDMyaMzEmB33M" data-image-id="0*vgWlDMyaMzEmB33M" data-width="1200" data-height="630" /></figure>

<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#1. Find The Providers In Your Niche</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">The outsourcing industry in India is vast, and there are a lot of providers to choose from. Understanding how their services work will help you narrow down your search for an appropriate provider that can meet all of the requirements!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">The first step in selecting an appropriate company for this purpose would be to understand what services they provide and whether their capabilities align with your processes or not.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Here are some aspects that you must consider :</p>
<ul class="postList" style="text-align: justify;">
<li class="graf graf--li">Tasks that are typically outsourced in your niche.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Risks involved with outsourcing.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">What measures can you take to mitigate risks?</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">It will allow you to understand every aspect of IT outsourcing associated with your business and contemplate the risks involved.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#2. Decide On Processes To Outsource</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">The next thing is to decide what activity you want to outsource. Outsourcing to India can help save money, but it’s not worth doing if the task will just be given away without any effort on your end or expertise necessary.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">It often ends up costing more than having someone else take care of things in the house! It also has other benefits such as scalability (you’re only responsible for one department) efficiency through specialization.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">On top of that, there are many instances where outsourcing makes sense, such as software development.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#3 Partner With Reliable IT Outsourcing Company</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">Partnering with a service provider is the best way to ensure that your business can grow. You’ll have access not only to their expertise but also to resources such as employees and the software platform they provide.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;">So, you don’t need any other outside help or equipment besides what’s already in place at home! Search through reviews before deciding on who will be your partner.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: justify;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#4. Invest In Right Tools</strong></h3>

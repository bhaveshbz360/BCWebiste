										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 2021, retail eCommerce sales amounted to approximately 4.9 trillion U.S. dollars globally. This figure is expected to grow by 50 percent over the next four years, reaching about 7.4 trillion dollars by 2025. With platforms like WordPress and Shopify, today it is easier for businesses to create an online store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress has long been the leading platform for starting a website, while Shopify is well known as an easy way to set up an online store and start selling products or services immediately. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many great reasons to choose either of these platforms, but they come with pros &amp; cons that you should consider while deciding which way to go. </span>WordPress vs. Shopify,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is best for your business? In this blog, we will compare both‌, so you can determine which will be right for your requirement.</span></p>
<h2>wQuick Overview</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify and WordPress are two of the most popular eCommerce platforms on the web. When choosing which platform to use for your site, it&#8217;s important to weigh factors such as cost, scalability, and design focus. Let&#8217;s inspect and compare </span>WordPress vs. Shopify<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you make an informed decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress &amp; Shopify offer free plans available to users, but they differ in functionality. While you can build an online store on both platforms, WordPress is geared more towards bloggers and website owners than those looking to launch an online store. You&#8217;ll need to use a theme designed for eCommerce if you want your site to sell products or services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms can create your website, but WordPress is the more versatile option. It&#8217;s free to download, easy to install &amp; edit yourself, and there are many plugins (like WooCommerce) that you can use to build an online store.</span> <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/top-wordpress-development-services-company-india?utm_source=Organic+-+ValueCoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">WordPress Website Services Company</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will guide you through setting up a business page with great content and then implement Search Engine Optimization techniques to rank it on search engines for the specific product or service you offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Shopify is a turnkey solution. It&#8217;s not free, but you don&#8217;t have to do anything other than plug in your content to get your store up and to run. It has many add-ons and partners that care for things like marketing, design, and customer service. It means you&#8217;re paying a monthly fee and won&#8217;t be able to control every element of your business like with WordPress.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Setup &amp; Hosting In WordPress &amp; Shopify</strong></h2>
<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p>WordPress Vs Shopify, <span style="font-weight: 400;">which one has better setup and hosting features? Let’s start with WordPress. You&#8217;ll need to download and install the software on your web hosting. Once you have a hosting account and the installation is complete, you&#8217;ll be able to log in to your dashboard. Here, you will find all of your WordPress settings. You&#8217;ll be able to upload themes from here, manage plugins and build a network of users who can log into your site and edit content without breaking anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In WordPress, a theme controls your website&#8217;s design. Once you&#8217;ve logged into your dashboard, you&#8217;ll be able to upload a new theme and customize its settings by changing background images, uploading custom header graphics, and inputting text into content areas. These themes come with unique features, such as sidebars that can be managed within specific post types to include different ads or calls-to-action throughout different posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, WordPress is entirely open-source. You can download the program to your computer and run it there (or on a hosting provider). You&#8217;ll pay just a one-time license fee and, most times, nothing to host it. Plus, if you&#8217;re working with a theme from outside the WordPress store (like from somewhere like ThemeForest), you&#8217;ll need to install the theme manually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes about ten minutes for anyone who knows what they&#8217;re doing; some of that time is just connecting files properly. Setup and hosting in WordPress are free, but you must deal with updates. Themes are also free in most cases, but you&#8217;ll have to handle updates yourself. And when you want an add-on like WooCommerce for selling goods online, you&#8217;ll need to purchase that.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3>Shopify</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One important aspect to remember when comparing </span>WordPress vs Shopify <span style="font-weight: 400;">is that a hosting service is required to run WordPress. Shopify provides both hosting and a customizable storefront. If you own an eCommerce website, using one service that manages everything makes sense to spend more time building your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosting in Shopify also includes security features like firewalls and malware scanning, unlimited bandwidth, storage space, and data transfer. With a hosted site on Shopify&#8217;s platform, you get automatic backups each day, which means if something happens to your site, there will be a copy stored offsite just waiting for restoration! No need to worry about manually backing up files or managing your server&#8217;s storage space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business needs will dictate what platform would work best for you. It is worth considering the traffic your site generates, how frequently content updates are needed, whether you have technical skills, and how much control over design and branding you want to have before making a decision. </span></p>

<h2><strong>Security &amp; Support In WordPress &amp; Shopify </strong></h2>
<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important consideration is the site&#8217;s security. WordPress sites are typically more secure than those running on other platforms because over 50% of the internet&#8217;s websites use the platform. Plus, as a self-hosted platform, WordPress has a stronger safety net since you can update it as needed. And if something goes wrong on your WordPress site, you&#8217;re equipped with tools to diagnose and fix it quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With WordPress, you can use free and open-source software, although your site will not be hosted on a secure server unless you upgrade to a paid plan. If you want more options for customization and support, then it’s best to Hire WordPress Developers to  build your online store. It’s important to consider WordPress hosting cost, too; it might prove difficult if you don’t have a developer who can set up all of these components.</span></p>
<h3>Shopify</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is also an issue with both WordPress and Shopify. While it’s not unheard of to be hacked, many security breaches happen due to mistakes made by those running a website, such as installing third-party plug-ins that introduce vulnerabilities into your site or failing to keep your software up-to-date. It is essential to keep everything up-to-date at all times. If you are not sure how to do it yourself, then consider hiring someone who does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shopify, your data is encrypted through SSL and hosted on the fast and secure Amazon Web Services platform, making your website secure. You get more control over your content because you don&#8217;t have to edit the code to make changes on your site- an important aspect that may save time and headaches in the long run. If a technical issue arises with your website, help is available 24/7 to resolve any problems.</span></p>
<h2><strong>WordPress &amp; Shopify: Price Comparison </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an open-source content management system, WordPress costs nothing . You can set up a free website and blog within minutes.  It has four level plans, Personal, Premium, Business, and eCommerce, that help you grow your business with the help of an error-free website. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26791" title="WordPress Latest Price" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price.png" alt="WordPress Latest Price" height="844" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price.png 1700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-300x149.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-1024x508.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-768x381.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-1536x763.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px" /> WordPress Latest Price</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://wordpress.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Image Source</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify offers four levels of monthly plans: Starter, Shopify, Advanced, and Shopifyplus for enterprise-grade solutions. The first two are the least expensive. The advanced plan includes 24 hours of support.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26792" title="Shopify Latest Price" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price.png" alt="Shopify Latest Price" height="654" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price.png 1599w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-300x123.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-1024x419.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-768x314.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-1536x628.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1599px) 100vw, 1599px" /> Shopify Latest Price</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.shopify.com/in/pricing?term=shopify%20plans&amp;adid=566070193615&amp;campaignid=15433369407&amp;branded_enterprise=1&amp;BOID=brand&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1ICZBhAzEiwAFfvFhMu_-1mfLa7HWPWC-NM5yezXQkW2relnHIWNNidEYhQpsrJQF0WkhRoCIIgQAvD_BwE&amp;cmadid=516585705;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494758;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Image Source</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a more cost-effective option, consider Shopify. You won’t get live customer support with a standard account, but you do have access to their large knowledge base. For $14 per month on a basic plan or $29 per month on an unlimited plan, you can have your domain name and website with ease of use, similar to WordPress.</span></p>
<h2>Help &amp; Support</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is also an issue with both WordPress and Shopify. While it’s not unheard of to be hacked, many security breaches happen due to mistakes running a website, such as installing third-party plug-ins that introduce vulnerabilities into your site or failing to keep your software up-to-date. It is crucial  to keep everything up-to-date at all times. If you aren’t sure how to do it yourself, then consider hiring someone who does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shopify, your data is encrypted through SSL and hosted on the fast and secure Amazon Web Services platform. This makes your website more secure than if you used WordPress. Additionally, you have more control over your content because you don&#8217;t have to edit the code to make changes on your site- an important aspect that may save time and headaches in the long run. If a technical issue arises with your website, help is available 24/7 to resolve any problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, WordPress is just as important to install reliable plugins and keep them updated. Instead of paying monthly fees, </span>WordPress Website Services Company <span style="font-weight: 400;">charges per hour, which can add up quickly depending on the complexity of your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress security and support offers three layers of protection against hackers &#8211; file system level security, brute force login protection, and firewall protection from denial of service attacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will always have access to online resources (forums) to solve problems without paying monthly hosting fees. You will never need to bother about downtime as every hosting provider provides a 99% uptime guarantee, but you should take steps to protect your site with a backup plan before launching, so there are no surprises if something goes wrong.</span></p>
<h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to SEO, there are some differences in terms of technology and focus. WordPress is a blogging platform primarily built around optimizing content for Google. In contrast, Shopify is designed primarily as an eCommerce store builder, so while they have options for creating content like blogs and galleries within their site, their focus is mostly on providing the best experience possible for shoppers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms offer integrations with platforms like Google shopping ads or Facebook ads. But since each has a different design philosophy, these integrations might not work the same way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both platforms can build online stores, each allows you to host and share your content. So if you are struggling to decide on </span>WordPress Vs Shopify, <span style="font-weight: 400;">consider your requirements; you may need to determine where you are currently in your blogging journey.</span></p>

<h2>Market Tools &amp; Features</h2>
<p>In comparing WordPress vs Shopify, now let&#8217;s look at the market tools and features of each platform. Both offer unique tools &amp; features that might or might not meet your business requirement. For a better understanding, let us look at the features of both platforms and decide which one best suits your business:</p>
<h3>Shopify:</h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can start the online store without investing much money, which is good news if you are running on a shoestring budget. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can have your store functioning in minutes using what’s known as a theme. It’s a website template designed to be easy to install. It  will save you work hours because all you have to do is add content, images, and prices. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify doesn&#8217;t offer a lot of integrations. It offers apps from Google and Facebook so that you can sync your social media accounts with your storefront.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that need more than just those two integrations (like MailChimp) might want to consider another provider like Bigcommerce or Squarespace.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms allow customers to buy anything from physical goods to digital products.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>WordPress:</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress is open-source and available to download for free, so if you’re interested in using it to power your website, you can do so without having to pay a dime or commit any money upfront.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress also has an active community of developers and bloggers who are always updating the platform with new features and improvements on the go, which means that the software will never grow outdated over time.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There is no shortage of plugins compatible with the core WordPress program, as well as a variety of other third-party products that help automate everything from SEO management to shipping logistics.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress is best suited for individuals with little to no programming experience who want a free way to manage their online store. On the flip side, those looking for more advanced features should look into Shopify instead.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Themes are essential when designing a professional-looking website. WordPress offers a range of pre-made themes (free and paid), but there are still not quite as many options available compared to Shopify.</span></li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify is a phenomenon in eCommerce. It has spiked the business penetration in such a way that was unprecedented before. An old concept of business  “CONSUMER IS KING.” It gives buyers an exciting experience in the most innovative manner, unlike any other platform. Thus, it adds popularity and gives an enthralling shopping experience you would always like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us look into Shopify cart software and enhance the probability of running into Shopify. But why? </span></p>
<p><b>&#8220;According to CAGR, 2021 to 2025 of </b><b>6.7%</b><b>, Shopify projected market volume surpasses </b><b>$1.6</b><b> billion in 2025.&#8221;</b></p>
<h3><b>What Is Shopify?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify is a cloud-based shopping cart solution, working as SaaS, which enables businesses across industries and sets up online stores, sells products quickly and effectively. It is gaining popularity and listed amongst the top 10 Shopify development companies in 2020-2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s time, maintaining social distancing is a platform, giving Shopify development a noticeable boost. The most remarkable thing about </span>Shopify website development company<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it should provide top-notch service at affordable rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it’s’ all about the appeal and attraction; that’s how </span>Shopify development agency<span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you numerous pricing plans with extensive features that fit in well with businesses of all sizes across industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify excites everyone and bemuses all. You are a startup or a large enterprise; everyone can benefit from using the Shopify eCommerce platform and offering several integrations to upscale the software and business fortunes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the year 2021, businesses across the world are recuperating, and eCommerce is no exception either. Many companies are roping into Shopify to sell their products.

<p><strong><i>So many of us ask why all these upcoming brands and businesses on Shopify are? To answer this, let me strike out a couple of Shopify advantages.</i></strong></p>
<p><b>Easy To Use:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most appealing and the biggest reason is that merchant users love Shopify. Anyone across the country can use it without being confused. They don&#8217;t need a developer to add items to the site or add filters.</span></p>
<p><b>Simple: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating discount coupons, adding discounts, and processing orders using Shopify is quite uncomplicated and straightforward. This platform gives you a user-friendly design with a drag &amp; drop editing tool.</span></p>
<p><b>Low Startup Cost:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify is quite affordable since it is available at a low and reasonable monthly fee. One can experience a Shopify plan which varies between $29 to $79 and is inexpensive, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><b>Elegant Themes: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify provides an extensive range of </span><b><i>user-friendly, smart, and mobile responsive themes</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for the merchants to choose from. If you are looking for more options, Shopify offers premium (paid) themes.</span></p>
<p><b>Apt For Drop-shipping:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drop shippers like Shopify. They can easily integrate with Oberoi and Spocket, which makes drop shipping easy.</span></p>
<p><b>Plenty of Support Options: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessibility to tech support and round-the-clock availability with services like chat, phone, and email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we see no. of multiple Shopify development companies worldwide, which allows us to choose the best Shopify development company for the next Shopify project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help you make the right decision, I’m compiling a list of the <strong>best</strong></span><b> Shopify development companies in 2021–2022</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worthy of your attention.</span></p>

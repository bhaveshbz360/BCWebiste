										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">The internet has made it attainable for people to learn and train anytime, anywhere. This new era of learning has been a major shift from the traditional classroom setting as we know it today with its face-to-face interaction between instructor and student — but don’t worry!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Online courses allow you (the learner) more freedom than ever before: they’re flexible enough that accommodate your busy schedule or short attention span; interactive so instructors can answer questions instantly instead of waiting until class ends like those pesky postdated checks which always seem super relevant when receiving them six months later than expected.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you are associated with the learning and education industry, you must be wondering why you need to create an <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/elearning-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">e-learning solution</a>. However, you must be wondering which is the best e-learning app development company, then you need to decide on a country to hire developers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Actually, different countries have diverse perk-set that can turn out boons for your project development in terms of cost and innovation.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Let’s take a glance at the top countries to outsource e-learning software development.</span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">India has several advantages that make it ideal for this industry. As an established outsourcing industry with decades of experience. Low labor costs allow for a high volume of work to be completed cost-effectively.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ukraine:</strong> Ukraine is another ideal location for eLearning software development due to its low living expenses, favorable tax rate, and high availability of talent. With over 100 higher education institutions that have computer science programs, the country is home to many talented developers who are eager to transition their skills into eLearning software development opportunities.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Russia</strong>: Russia is another top country for e-learning software development. Russia has over 450 higher education institutions that offer computer science programs, and around 100,000 students graduate from these schools each year with degrees in this field of study.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are many more reasons why developers should consider looking into the high-demand options to work on learning projects within Russia.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Poland:</strong> Poland is also one of the top countries for eLearning software development due to its low living expenses, favorable tax rate, and highly educated workforce. With over 800 higher education institutions that offer computer science programs in this country alone, there are many opportunities to find talented developers with experience within learning technology platforms.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">You must be wondering that what the cost of e-Learning mobile app development or software development is in these countries. Following is the hourly price chart that gives some notion into the cost of development depending on the complexity of the project.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">India : $25- $50/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Ukraine: $19-$60/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Russia: $20-$35/hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Poland : $20-$75/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Romania : $15-$25/hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Bulgaria : $20-$50/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">China : $19-$39/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Mexico : $30-$61/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Colombia : $25-$60/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Israel : $31-$75/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Singapore : $25-$60/Hour</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">From above, it would be clear that you can find countries with diverse skill sets and different developer prices. Meantime, you have to look for other aspects such as the communication skill and knowledge of your field.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>Some Frequently Asked Questions That You Must Look</strong></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong>What are Offshore Developer Rates by Country?</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The average hourly rate of a software engineer is $35-$45, while developers from Latin American countries like Brazil or Mexico typically ask for about 30 hours. Indian engineers demand rates between 20–30 dollars per hour on projects involving implementing new features to existing systems.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A lot can be learned when researching how much each country pays its developers; the Ukraine market has been reported as being rather inexpensive at around 25 USD, but other regions such as Poland may have higher salaries averaging close to 65 EURO (or 6000 Zlotych) Per Day! Developers working in Romania usually get paid according to an Hourly Rate.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How Much Is Indian Developers’ Hourly Price?</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">According to eLearning Mind, Indian software developers are some of the cheapest in the world. Their rate is $23/hr (USD). eLearning Mind found <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">eLearning software development company</strong> in India will charge as low as $23 an hour.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why Should You Get Education Software Development Services From India?</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">In reality, Hire Developers From India for education software developers for services are not all the same. While they may come from a similar background, each individual brings something different to their team and knowledge base. Hiring developers from India is no different than hiring anywhere else in that regard.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In fact, some of the best talents can be found here, as there’s so much competition for <a style="color: #252525;" href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hiring developers from India</a> that will help your company in a number of different ways. It can provide great customer service, and developers with Indian backgrounds can be effective at working with individuals from other cultures as well because they’ve experienced it themselves.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Wrapping Up</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Today, more educational institutions are adopting e-learning. With the steady increase in affordable tech devices for learning on hand, as well as the growing demand for engaging experiences, it is no surprise that moving to an online strategy yields many benefits when compared with physical classrooms alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software developers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know well how daunting the task of creating e-learning software can be. They all hope to build six-figure, engaging, and informative learning solutions. It </span>is imperative for an e-learning business to create e-learning software and courses for mass-market needs. However, the process of getting there often feels complex. After all, e-learning app development is a one-way process where developers work without knowing learners and their needs. That’s where agile software development services can help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With agile software development, e-learning software solutions are built by taking into account the design principles, planning sessions, and collaboration between the development side and the business side. This process is also easy and incurs less cost.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><b>Creating Custom E-learning Software</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all starts with the development of a learning management system (LMS). I have one option to show you here. This is a web-based </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/student-learning-management-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>learning management system</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> built on .Net, MVC5, and Decoupled Architecture. This is a learning management system (LMS) designed for the administration and delivery of informational and educational content to people who are preparing for their exams. What makes our app unique is that it works well and support features:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-12764 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unnamed-2-300x123.png" alt="" width="623" height="256" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unnamed-2-300x123.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/unnamed-2.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create media options via PDFs, videos, classroom sessions, and SCORM.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create tests, quizzes, and exams by using adjustable grading criteria and randomization for preventing cheating.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve learner&#8217;s interaction by creating discussion forums and then exchange ideas, knowledge, and opinions in the forums.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tool assigns specific tasks, goals, and courses to each of its users </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracks the growth of participants via insightful reports.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content flexibility in the form of creating your own content by integrating cutting-edge courses taught by our domain experts.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track training progress through live sessions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom dashboards that allow users to view important info at a glance.</span></li>
<li>Authenticated access to prevent unauthorized access and cheating.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a responsive interface that works across all devices automatically.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><b>What can be included in the development plan?</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://elearningindustry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/growth-of-the-elearning-market.jpg" alt="Growth Of The eLearning Market - eLearning Industry" width="649" height="365" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/big-data-in-elearning-opportunities" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">elearningindustry</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customized e-learning solutions are created after the eLearning course plan is done. At this stage, the developer can start programming and must work together closely with the client. The developer will most likely need to clarify some questions from the clients to do their job well. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Here are some questions they might ask:</strong></span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have any examples from your organization or working space that can be included in the e-learning software solution?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there any specific requirements basis on the scenario the learner want to choose?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should happen if a user wants the complete course?</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The e-learning software development process might take longer since there&#8217;s one developer doing the job. As such, it&#8217;s always a better idea to </span>hire one e-learning development team<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Depending on the project needs, you might ask the team if they specialize in building complex e-learning software and apps or not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Either way, the circle of e-learning software development includes the following:</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requirements analysis of the project: Preparing a detailed plan for tech specifications takes a lot of time. The development team setup basic requirements so the developers know what they need to build.</span></li>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><b>Technologies Used for e-Learning Software Development</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cloud Computing:</strong> Cloud computing is nothing but a group of computing resources located at various places in the world. Cloud computing guarantees e-learners access to data on any gadgets from anywhere in the world.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Internet of Things (IoT):</strong> IoT is a useful technology that creates a global network among educators and learners. The technology helps e-learners to interact with their educators worldwide.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> The technology helps in personalized learning which is one of the most important areas of education. AI helps learners to find the best course material based on their interests, and your way of learning. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Augmented/Virtual Reality:</strong> The visual content catches the student’s attention so quickly. It also ensures the engagement and interaction of the students and what they are learning.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are working in the realm of e-learning, having an e-learning software solution or LMS can be a great solution to all your issues. You should take advantage of the e-learning <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/a-comprehensive-guide-on-software-development-features-tools-benefits-and-more/?utm_source=elearning&amp;utm_medium=wblog_12765&amp;utm_campaign=rg121" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software features</a> and functionality. You can review other users that have had the same LMS software for creating successful online courses and online classes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, it was a great experience for our development team to work on the LMS software solution. At each step of the project, we ensured that our development team and client were on the same page by using agile methodologies. This helped us to stay well-organized throughout the process. On the other hand, before start working on the LMS project, you should know what modules, tools, platforms, technologies can be added to your e-learning software. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, there are e-learning app development platforms that you can use for the development of LMS or e-learning software. These platforms are also divided into three categories: open-source, proprietary, and partly free. Here are the options that you can select. </span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Open edX</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> It is a free open-source learning management platform built on Python and the xBlock ideology. It enables online instructors to create self-paced courses using a single platform.</span></li>
<li><strong>Blackboard</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>:</strong> It is a proprietary LMS platform that spans teaching and e-learning ensuring that the learner experience is the best both online and in the classroom. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the LMS and e-learning software simply replicate traditional educational techniques. Modern LMS provides means to restructure the entire e-learning solutions and help meet the needs of the changing education environment.   </span></p>

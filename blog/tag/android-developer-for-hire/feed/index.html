										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Do you want to create a mobile app, but are you not sure how to get it designed well to attract users?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, a great app experience is a magic ingredient for your app&#8217;s success. Not only does it entice users to visit your application multiple times, but it also makes Android app development hassle-free by defining concise design boundaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are striving to secure an application with a splendid look and feel, you can leverage various UX/UI design strategies that can make your app look hot and sour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will look over some UX/UI design methods for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/android-app-development-company-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">android app development</a> that can add crispness to your app design and can make it the biggest hit in the year 2020. </span></p>
<h2><b>UX/ UI Design &#8211; The Magic Ingredient </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telling the importance of eloquent user experience design is quite difficult. Though, we can simply understand that UX design strives to fulfill the users’ needs in accordance with the look and feel of the app.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, users’ complete journey on your application depends upon the user experience. This is a simple roadmap that allows you to define the entry and exit of a user on your application. A concise and well-constructed UX /UI design is the major factor for the success of various business applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, UX/UI design is all about how a person feels while interacting with your application. Is he finds it hard to use? Can he navigate through different features and options easily? Well! App design strategies usually consider these questions and aim for a positive impression.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2><b>How to create an incredible UX/UI design for your app? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several things to consider while designing your mobile app. Here are some points that can help to strategize your design practice. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span><b> # Emphasize On App Experience </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An app comprises value when people find it and use it. Thus, engaging the target audience is the most prominent goal, and this you can achieve by creating something that people want to experience. Thus, </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=richandroidapp_13287_rg121&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software outsourcing companies</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> always focus on the app experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern users are looking for more ease and interactivity in apps, thus the use of Augmented reality is gaining significant traction. Making an enjoyable and delightful user experience can boost user app credibility and can steal the eyes. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13309" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="340" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While user experience is all about the users’ perception and interaction with the application. UX design combines visuals, sounds, actions, touch, social stigma, and emotions to create an outstanding user experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is to “give users what they want and a bit additional”. With your application, offer your services effectively and efficiently, while compelling them to think, “Wow, this app is excellent”.</span></p>

<hr />
<h4><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are some points that you must be mindful of</span>: </strong></em></h4>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Never utilize inconsistent and wrong icons for basic functions like Edit, Delete, Share, Send, etc. The basic purpose of every icon must be defined and clear. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always determine the accuracy and quality of your UI on different devices having indifferent screen sizes. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never stuff the screen with too much content and icons. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always use good quality graphics. Most should have common sizes. </span></li>
</ol>

<hr />
<h3><b># Declutter </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major recommendation in almost every design guide is “declutter”. Decluttering makes your interface look easy and lite. Remember, clutter is the biggest enemy of your app design. Thus, overloading too much information on your app screen can ruin your app look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every icon, image, and button can make the app screen complicated, so choose wisely. Believe me; clutter looks worse on the mobile screen. So, be mindful of decluttering, and follow the given practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13306" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1.png" alt="" width="512" height="270" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /> </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never show too much information to users. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always keep content to a minimum. Focus on users&#8217; needs. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure to keep minimum interface elements. Design simple and make it extremely easy. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive disclosure techniques can be helpful for showing several options. </span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b># Use Modern Design Trends </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the arrival of many new technologies, UX/UI design trends also change. Leveraging design trends can help you stun the people. It will also help in attracting your target audience uniquely. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Don’t Fall In The Low-Cost Trap</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next essential </span>Android developer hiring tip<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not to fall into the low-cost trap of hiring a </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>mobile app development company</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your startup or SME. It&#8217;s true; everyone loves a good deal, but when it comes to app development, choosing the cheapest option can often lead to more significant costs and headaches down the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s break down why falling into the low-cost trap is something you should steer clear of:</span></p>
<p><b>Quality Matters: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you hire Android developers at rock-bottom prices, you might compromise on the quality of your app. Low-cost developers may cut corners or lack the skills to create a polished and efficient application.</span></p>
<p><b>Hidden Costs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Although the initial price might seem attractive, low-cost developers might not provide comprehensive services. This could result in hidden costs when fixing bugs, updating, or scaling your app.</span></p>
<p><b>Longer Timelines: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving money upfront may extend your project&#8217;s timeline. Inexperienced developers may struggle with delays, harming your startup&#8217;s goals.</span></p>
<p><b>Security Concerns: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-cost developers may not prioritize robust security measures, leaving your app vulnerable to data breaches and other threats.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android development is a huge and growing market. With 88% of total Smartphone users, Android tops the chart as a Smartphone mobile operating system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per a recent </span><a href="https://cyfuture.com/blog/android-app-development-vs-ios-app-development-which-platform-is-best/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Android OS market share was 74% in 2020 compared to the 24% share of iOS, which is the highest market share of any operating system.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-23928 size-full" title="Mobile Market" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed-1.png" alt="Mobile Market" width="457" height="264" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed-1.png 457w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/unnamed-1-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, it’s a mandate for you to build a mobile app for Android. However, for that, you need to hire Android developers who have experience and certain skills to match your requirement. Here comes the real challenge-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing number of Smartphone users and the popularity of Android latest versions have created immense opportunities for mobile development companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will find firms saying they have the skills to fulfill your requirements now and then. This makes it even harder to pick the diamond from the coal mine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, before you end up making a wrong decision, check for these seven skills your development partner is offering or not:</span></p>
<h2><b>Find out 10 Skills To Check Before You Hire Android Developers</b></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">  1) Expertise in Java</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An android developer must have expertise in Java. Native development requires using Java, and an Android developer must be competent with most of the complex Java syntax and its programming structures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the android developer should know object-oriented concepts like inheritance, class vs. static methods, hibernate, and Java. The developer should have an excellent knowledge of variables, loops, control structure, lists, etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/java-and-android.png" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6322" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/java-and-android.png" alt="java and android" width="809" height="572" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/java-and-android.png 809w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/java-and-android-600x424.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/java-and-android-300x212.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/java-and-android-768x543.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></a></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">2) Proficient In SQL</h3>
<p>One of the skills you should check before hiring an Android developer is whether they are proficient in SQL. SQL is a database query language that is used to manage data in relational databases.</p>
<p>Android developers need to be able to use SQLite, which is a lightweight version of SQL that is designed for mobile devices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sqlite-and-Android.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6323" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sqlite-and-Android.jpg" alt="sqlite-and-Android" width="809" height="455" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sqlite-and-Android.jpg 2165w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sqlite-and-Android-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sqlite-and-Android-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sqlite-and-Android-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/sqlite-and-Android-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></a></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">  3) Effective XML Coding</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the core development of your mobile application is done in Java, effective coding in XML is required to give it a good look. XML will help you create layouts that will serve as the foundational UI definition for Android mobile applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, XML is a standard way to code data for internet-based apps. It allows information to be passed between devices that can be understood consistently. Here’s the architecture:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/XML_Configurations-for-android.png" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6324" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/XML_Configurations-for-android.png" alt="XML_Configurations for android" width="809" height="607" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/XML_Configurations-for-android.png 640w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/XML_Configurations-for-android-600x450.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/XML_Configurations-for-android-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></a></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">  4) Android SDK Knowledge</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android developers must know the Android Software development Kit (SDK). The developers must know a basic understanding of layouts and views, user input, getting data from the web, action bar, accommodating different screen sizes, storing data, activities and life cycle, and densities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developer must also have good knowledge of Android documentation. Hence, before you hire android developers, check Android SDK&#8217;s skills as well.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5) Working In Android Studio</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Android Studio integrated development environment pulls together all the tools needed to write an Android application with the functions you need to test and debug it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android Studio allows you to take advantage of the features and shortcuts it provides to help you efficiently and effectively create bug-free code.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">  6) Keen To Learn More: <span style="color: #ffffff;">hire android developers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the new updates regularly coming, android development standards change very quickly.

<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">  7) Communication &amp; Collaboration Skills</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another essential skill to check for in an Android developer is their communication and collaboration skills. Android development is a team-based process, so the developer you hire must be able to communicate effectively with other members of your team. </span></p>

<h3>9) Familiarity with Agile development methodology</h3>

<p>If a potential Android developer is familiar with the Agile development process, it will be easier for them to adapt to your company&#8217;s way of working.</p>
<h3>10) Android UI and UX Design understanding</h3>
<p>A good Android developer should have a strong understanding of both UI and UX design principles. They should be able to create apps that not only look great but are also easy to use and navigate.</p>
<p>If a potential candidate doesn&#8217;t seem to understand the importance of UI and UX design, they may not be the right fit for your team. This way, you will end up having a beautiful and effective product.</p>

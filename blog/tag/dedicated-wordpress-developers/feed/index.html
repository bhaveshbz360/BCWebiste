										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 2021, retail eCommerce sales amounted to approximately 4.9 trillion U.S. dollars globally. This figure is expected to grow by 50 percent over the next four years, reaching about 7.4 trillion dollars by 2025. With platforms like WordPress and Shopify, today it is easier for businesses to create an online store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress has long been the leading platform for starting a website, while Shopify is well known as an easy way to set up an online store and start selling products or services immediately. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many great reasons to choose either of these platforms, but they come with pros &amp; cons that you should consider while deciding which way to go. </span>WordPress vs. Shopify,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is best for your business? In this blog, we will compare both‌, so you can determine which will be right for your requirement.</span></p>
<h2>wQuick Overview</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify and WordPress are two of the most popular eCommerce platforms on the web. When choosing which platform to use for your site, it&#8217;s important to weigh factors such as cost, scalability, and design focus. Let&#8217;s inspect and compare </span>WordPress vs. Shopify<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you make an informed decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress &amp; Shopify offer free plans available to users, but they differ in functionality. While you can build an online store on both platforms, WordPress is geared more towards bloggers and website owners than those looking to launch an online store. You&#8217;ll need to use a theme designed for eCommerce if you want your site to sell products or services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms can create your website, but WordPress is the more versatile option. It&#8217;s free to download, easy to install &amp; edit yourself, and there are many plugins (like WooCommerce) that you can use to build an online store.</span> <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/top-wordpress-development-services-company-india?utm_source=Organic+-+ValueCoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">WordPress Website Services Company</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will guide you through setting up a business page with great content and then implement Search Engine Optimization techniques to rank it on search engines for the specific product or service you offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Shopify is a turnkey solution. It&#8217;s not free, but you don&#8217;t have to do anything other than plug in your content to get your store up and to run. It has many add-ons and partners that care for things like marketing, design, and customer service. It means you&#8217;re paying a monthly fee and won&#8217;t be able to control every element of your business like with WordPress.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Setup &amp; Hosting In WordPress &amp; Shopify</strong></h2>
<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p>WordPress Vs Shopify, <span style="font-weight: 400;">which one has better setup and hosting features? Let’s start with WordPress. You&#8217;ll need to download and install the software on your web hosting. Once you have a hosting account and the installation is complete, you&#8217;ll be able to log in to your dashboard. Here, you will find all of your WordPress settings. You&#8217;ll be able to upload themes from here, manage plugins and build a network of users who can log into your site and edit content without breaking anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In WordPress, a theme controls your website&#8217;s design. Once you&#8217;ve logged into your dashboard, you&#8217;ll be able to upload a new theme and customize its settings by changing background images, uploading custom header graphics, and inputting text into content areas. These themes come with unique features, such as sidebars that can be managed within specific post types to include different ads or calls-to-action throughout different posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, WordPress is entirely open-source. You can download the program to your computer and run it there (or on a hosting provider). You&#8217;ll pay just a one-time license fee and, most times, nothing to host it. Plus, if you&#8217;re working with a theme from outside the WordPress store (like from somewhere like ThemeForest), you&#8217;ll need to install the theme manually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes about ten minutes for anyone who knows what they&#8217;re doing; some of that time is just connecting files properly. Setup and hosting in WordPress are free, but you must deal with updates. Themes are also free in most cases, but you&#8217;ll have to handle updates yourself. And when you want an add-on like WooCommerce for selling goods online, you&#8217;ll need to purchase that.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3>Shopify</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One important aspect to remember when comparing </span>WordPress vs Shopify <span style="font-weight: 400;">is that a hosting service is required to run WordPress. Shopify provides both hosting and a customizable storefront. If you own an eCommerce website, using one service that manages everything makes sense to spend more time building your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosting in Shopify also includes security features like firewalls and malware scanning, unlimited bandwidth, storage space, and data transfer. With a hosted site on Shopify&#8217;s platform, you get automatic backups each day, which means if something happens to your site, there will be a copy stored offsite just waiting for restoration! No need to worry about manually backing up files or managing your server&#8217;s storage space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business needs will dictate what platform would work best for you. It is worth considering the traffic your site generates, how frequently content updates are needed, whether you have technical skills, and how much control over design and branding you want to have before making a decision. </span></p>

<h2><strong>Security &amp; Support In WordPress &amp; Shopify </strong></h2>
<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important consideration is the site&#8217;s security. WordPress sites are typically more secure than those running on other platforms because over 50% of the internet&#8217;s websites use the platform. Plus, as a self-hosted platform, WordPress has a stronger safety net since you can update it as needed. And if something goes wrong on your WordPress site, you&#8217;re equipped with tools to diagnose and fix it quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With WordPress, you can use free and open-source software, although your site will not be hosted on a secure server unless you upgrade to a paid plan. If you want more options for customization and support, then it’s best to Hire WordPress Developers to  build your online store. It’s important to consider WordPress hosting cost, too; it might prove difficult if you don’t have a developer who can set up all of these components.</span></p>
<h3>Shopify</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is also an issue with both WordPress and Shopify. While it’s not unheard of to be hacked, many security breaches happen due to mistakes made by those running a website, such as installing third-party plug-ins that introduce vulnerabilities into your site or failing to keep your software up-to-date. It is essential to keep everything up-to-date at all times. If you are not sure how to do it yourself, then consider hiring someone who does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shopify, your data is encrypted through SSL and hosted on the fast and secure Amazon Web Services platform, making your website secure. You get more control over your content because you don&#8217;t have to edit the code to make changes on your site- an important aspect that may save time and headaches in the long run. If a technical issue arises with your website, help is available 24/7 to resolve any problems.</span></p>
<h2><strong>WordPress &amp; Shopify: Price Comparison </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an open-source content management system, WordPress costs nothing . You can set up a free website and blog within minutes.  It has four level plans, Personal, Premium, Business, and eCommerce, that help you grow your business with the help of an error-free website. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26791" title="WordPress Latest Price" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price.png" alt="WordPress Latest Price" height="844" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price.png 1700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-300x149.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-1024x508.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-768x381.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-1536x763.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px" /> WordPress Latest Price</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://wordpress.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Image Source</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify offers four levels of monthly plans: Starter, Shopify, Advanced, and Shopifyplus for enterprise-grade solutions. The first two are the least expensive. The advanced plan includes 24 hours of support.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26792" title="Shopify Latest Price" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price.png" alt="Shopify Latest Price" height="654" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price.png 1599w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-300x123.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-1024x419.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-768x314.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-1536x628.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1599px) 100vw, 1599px" /> Shopify Latest Price</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.shopify.com/in/pricing?term=shopify%20plans&amp;adid=566070193615&amp;campaignid=15433369407&amp;branded_enterprise=1&amp;BOID=brand&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1ICZBhAzEiwAFfvFhMu_-1mfLa7HWPWC-NM5yezXQkW2relnHIWNNidEYhQpsrJQF0WkhRoCIIgQAvD_BwE&amp;cmadid=516585705;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494758;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Image Source</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a more cost-effective option, consider Shopify. You won’t get live customer support with a standard account, but you do have access to their large knowledge base. For $14 per month on a basic plan or $29 per month on an unlimited plan, you can have your domain name and website with ease of use, similar to WordPress.</span></p>
<h2>Help &amp; Support</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is also an issue with both WordPress and Shopify. While it’s not unheard of to be hacked, many security breaches happen due to mistakes running a website, such as installing third-party plug-ins that introduce vulnerabilities into your site or failing to keep your software up-to-date. It is crucial  to keep everything up-to-date at all times. If you aren’t sure how to do it yourself, then consider hiring someone who does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shopify, your data is encrypted through SSL and hosted on the fast and secure Amazon Web Services platform. This makes your website more secure than if you used WordPress. Additionally, you have more control over your content because you don&#8217;t have to edit the code to make changes on your site- an important aspect that may save time and headaches in the long run. If a technical issue arises with your website, help is available 24/7 to resolve any problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, WordPress is just as important to install reliable plugins and keep them updated. Instead of paying monthly fees, </span>WordPress Website Services Company <span style="font-weight: 400;">charges per hour, which can add up quickly depending on the complexity of your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress security and support offers three layers of protection against hackers &#8211; file system level security, brute force login protection, and firewall protection from denial of service attacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will always have access to online resources (forums) to solve problems without paying monthly hosting fees. You will never need to bother about downtime as every hosting provider provides a 99% uptime guarantee, but you should take steps to protect your site with a backup plan before launching, so there are no surprises if something goes wrong.</span></p>
<h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to SEO, there are some differences in terms of technology and focus. WordPress is a blogging platform primarily built around optimizing content for Google. In contrast, Shopify is designed primarily as an eCommerce store builder, so while they have options for creating content like blogs and galleries within their site, their focus is mostly on providing the best experience possible for shoppers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms offer integrations with platforms like Google shopping ads or Facebook ads. But since each has a different design philosophy, these integrations might not work the same way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both platforms can build online stores, each allows you to host and share your content. So if you are struggling to decide on </span>WordPress Vs Shopify, <span style="font-weight: 400;">consider your requirements; you may need to determine where you are currently in your blogging journey.</span></p>

<h2>Market Tools &amp; Features</h2>
<p>In comparing WordPress vs Shopify, now let&#8217;s look at the market tools and features of each platform. Both offer unique tools &amp; features that might or might not meet your business requirement. For a better understanding, let us look at the features of both platforms and decide which one best suits your business:</p>
<h3>Shopify:</h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can start the online store without investing much money, which is good news if you are running on a shoestring budget. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can have your store functioning in minutes using what’s known as a theme. It’s a website template designed to be easy to install. It  will save you work hours because all you have to do is add content, images, and prices. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify doesn&#8217;t offer a lot of integrations. It offers apps from Google and Facebook so that you can sync your social media accounts with your storefront.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that need more than just those two integrations (like MailChimp) might want to consider another provider like Bigcommerce or Squarespace.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms allow customers to buy anything from physical goods to digital products.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>WordPress:</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress is open-source and available to download for free, so if you’re interested in using it to power your website, you can do so without having to pay a dime or commit any money upfront.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress also has an active community of developers and bloggers who are always updating the platform with new features and improvements on the go, which means that the software will never grow outdated over time.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There is no shortage of plugins compatible with the core WordPress program, as well as a variety of other third-party products that help automate everything from SEO management to shipping logistics.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress is best suited for individuals with little to no programming experience who want a free way to manage their online store. On the flip side, those looking for more advanced features should look into Shopify instead.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Themes are essential when designing a professional-looking website. WordPress offers a range of pre-made themes (free and paid), but there are still not quite as many options available compared to Shopify.</span></li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">Website development can be really challenging if the team does not fit completely into the business requirement. The functionalities of a website must be constantly tested rectified for any issues.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The WordPress Developer you hire must have a thorough knowledge of the platform and should be able to make changes and upgrades on the site in a smooth manner. Getting the right set of dedicated developers to work on your project can add great value to it.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why Should You Hire WordPress Developers?</strong></h2>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Website Must Fit Your Needs</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">A WordPress developer is always well-versed in many of the standard coding languages used to create most WordPress themes and plugins. He or she can further tweak your purchased theme so that it works exactly how you want, whether its colors changing on a per post basis, adding new widget areas where needed, etc.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In addition, when you <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-wordpress-developers?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=hirewpdev-2798-d7&amp;utm_campaign=webblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>hire WordPress programmer</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">,</strong> he/she can craft a website from scratch based on how you envision it to look and work.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A lot of people don’t know that they have the power in their hands when choosing their own site design, which means there’s never been an easier time than now for entrepreneurs who want more freedom over what goes onto theirs!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Optimize Your Website For Search Engine</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When optimizing websites for search engines, most business owners tend to focus on applying on-page SEO techniques like including targeted keywords within their web page content and tags.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Others would build include offsite strategies such as guest posting into the mix but what many have been unaware of is the third type — Technical Search Engine Optimization or “Technical Seo” for short which can be used in order to make your site architecture easier (and more readable) by making use structured data, so bots are able easily to navigate through them!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Technical SEO means more than just including keywords in your content and tags. It’s all about making sure the website architecture, structured data are optimized so search engine bots can easily “read” it!</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Easy Customization</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Inevitably, you will think of ideas that need a developer immediately. For example: offering an online quiz on your site so users can determine which offer is best for them, and their needs could be easily created by one knowledgeable in this field.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If there isn’t already someone who knows how to do it when we find ourselves without developers at our disposal (imagine if they became unavailable), then all those plugins sitting idly just waiting until needed might as well stay where they’re put because once again-their performance impacts SERP rankings negatively anyway.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">WordPress is the ultimate tool for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/top-wordpress-development-services-company-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>WordPress web development</strong></a>, any business looking to quickly and easily create their own website. It has thousands of plugins that can be used in order to customize your site’s appearance, making it easy enough even if you’re not an experienced web designer.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, there are chances when I do have clients who need help picking out just what they want because sometimes all these options confuse us more than anything else — which leads me back again to “paralysis by analysis.”</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Improve User Experience</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">WordPress users are experts at optimizing the user experience for your site. They know that now, more than ever before, people want a simple and engaging website — which is absolutely what you can get from WordPress professionals! Search engines also reward sites with better rankings on these factors: dwell time (how long someone spends browsing) as well as page speed performance.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This means if you have an expert who has been trained in optimizing websites, so they rank higher by Google search algorithms, then trust them over any other company out there because this will give YOU credibility first hand instead of relying upon third party opinions or tools alone-even though those might be reliable too but getting personal feedback ensures 100% satisfaction guaranteed all round.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Enhanced Search Engine Optimize</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">WordPress management professionals and WordPress experts for hire possess the tools and expertise to improve your site’s search rankings. They are adept at implementing on-page optimization techniques for better SERP results, such as using keyword insertion in tags or meta description — all of which is possible with a little know-how from these SEO experts!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">And you won’t believe what they can do next: spy on competitors by collecting their top sources sending traffic away from yours so that we may apply knowledge gained through this research towards helping our client rise higher up page one listings faster than ever before imaginable.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Optimize For Mobile</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Google made the mobile experience a top priority in 2018 and gave higher rankings for sites optimized for small screens. That’s why it’s extremely critical than ever to hire professionals who instinctively develop responsive websites, creating flawless experiences on both desktops and smartphones alike with their designs compatible across most browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, or even Safari!</p>

<hr />
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>How would you hire the right set of developers for your site? Here are some questions that you must ask the WordPress developer before having him on board.</strong></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 1 Would you be using an existing theme or a custom theme to build a WordPress Site?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> The idea here is to understand the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">developer’s ability to differentiate</strong> between the options for theming a WordPress site.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">To develop a WordPress site, you can use an existing theme, customize a theme, and create a new theme from the start.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">An <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">existing theme</strong> is inexpensive from the other options but provides less opportunity to customize the website. The design may also be commonly found on other sites as these themes are picked up by many other companies.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Building your own theme</strong> on the other hand has many advantages. It can be customized to specific business requirements and niches. This may cost more but offers options to develop a website with lighter code and one that’s more according to business requirements.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Customizing an existing theme</strong> is also an option but has challenges with respect to incorporating updates in the theme.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Try to decipher, whether the developer has clarity with respect to the above options and why would he suggest a particular option for your project.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 2</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How would you Simplify content management on my website?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> Managing the content on a WordPress site is usually simple. But, you also need to ensure that your website should be developed in such a way that it can manage all content in a simplified manner.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Here are some things to know before developing a site that makes content management simpler.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">1. Use Widgets to add content on the home page.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">2. The Menus feature in WordPress for adding menus on the site.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">3. The templates feature for maintaining the structure of the page.</p>
<p> 4. The Slidebar feature in WordPress must provide adding footer and sidebar content</p>
<h3><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong" style="font-size: 12pt;">Q. 3 What would be the basic plugins required while building a WordPress website?</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> WordPress provides a host of plugins for adding different functionalities to your website. This feature makes it one of the most sought-after CMS in today’s times.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Here is the list of some of the basic plugins to install when you are creating a website related to the following:</p>

<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> The mobile device has become the most used device for reaching out to your target audiences. Or, you can make a website mobile-friendly only if it has capability to create a mobile version of itself. The second most common method is to create a responsive site that works well across devices.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 5</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What are the basics of hosting a WordPress website?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> Here are the points to consider while choosing a hosting solution provider for your business</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 7</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">How will you manage the backup of the WordPress site?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ans.</strong> Every WordPress website needs back up especially when you end up losing the data on your site. There are quite a few backup solutions available online, that help in backing up your website.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 8 What will a developer do to improve the speed of my WordPress site?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Ans. It takes a lot to keep people interested these days. Even if you make your website as easy and intuitive as possible, they’ll still leave after 3 seconds of loading time- which is why it’s so important for developers or companies not only to understand how crucial fast page loads actually can be but also do everything in their power (especially on mobile) towards achieving them!</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 9 How would you ensure the security of my WordPress site?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Ans. You should definitely ask your potential developer or company whether they will be using the newest security measures to protect your website. If not, don’t hire them!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So many hackers are targeting WordPress sites because of their popularity in this industry — so you need someone who can keep it safe for you too. Moreover, you need to ask about their backup procedure as well. This is because things can go wrong at any moment with all these attacks constantly happening on various platforms like Facebook etc. Hence, It will give you no peace until user data get compromised again.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q. 10 Will you be able to turn a WordPress site into an eCommerce store in the future?</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Ans. Being an online store owner, you may be wondering how to take your WordPress site and make it into something that looks more like brick-and-mortar retailers. You’ll want to check with developers about whether they specialize in eCommerce development for WooCommerce specifically because this type of programmatic software is what powers many stores today!</p>

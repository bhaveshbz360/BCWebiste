<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world where technology is changing every aspect of our lives, there is no question that the healthcare industry is one of them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the healthcare sector is heavily dependent on technology, thanks to growing technologies and trends that simplify medical facilities for patients. These include new drugs, surgical procedures, vaccines, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospitals and clinics can offer better and more effective services with the help of these technologies. IoT, or the Internet of Things, is one such technology in healthcare that is being highly used in this sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals and clinics have realized that implementing digital technologies across all areas is critically important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was when people were confined to their homes and used digital means to obtain needed healthcare assistance or services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these gave rise to the telehealth market. Hospitals and clinics had to shift towards digital methods as more patients started looking at the advantages of remote medical checkups and digital healthcare services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being efficient is very important for healthcare providers now. So, they see smart hospital solutions as the next step in using more digital technologies and systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog post will talk about smart hospitals, their benefits for patients and businesses, architecture, technologies, and more. We&#8217;ll also explore how you can make your hospitals more smarter.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is a Smart Hospital?</b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40242" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-is-a-Smart-Hospital_.jpg" alt="What is a Smart Hospital" width="860" height="400" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-is-a-Smart-Hospital_.jpg 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-is-a-Smart-Hospital_-300x140.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-is-a-Smart-Hospital_-768x357.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-is-a-Smart-Hospital_-480x223.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand smart hospitals, you first need to know about IoT (Internet of Things). It is a network of devices that can connect to the internet and share information or data.</span></p>
<p><b>A smart hospital is a digitally interconnected healthcare system that efficiently exchanges data between medical devices and IT infrastructure. </b></p>
<p><b>These advanced solutions streamline clinical and administrative workflows, boost operational efficiency, and enhance patient experiences and health outcomes.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a smart light bulb can automatically turn off when no one is in the room or change its brightness based on the time of day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the light bulb alone is not enough. It needs data from other sensors, like ones that detect how much natural light is coming in from outside. The light bulb and sensors sharing this data back and forth is a basic example of how IoT (Internet of Things) works.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not all! IoT has many uses, like collecting real-time data, tracking and managing equipment, and more. For these uses, IoT devices send their data to a central system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managers can then study this data, monitor equipment in real time, and control the IoT devices remotely from the central system. When all these components work together, it creates a fully functional IoT system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, consider applying everything you learned about IoT to hospitals and clinics. Each floor can have different devices and sensors that talk to each other. They send data to a main system where a manager can see it in real-time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manager can also control the devices from far away. This creates a smart hospital that helps staff take care of patients better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is known as a smart hospital solution as it automates processes without the need of human intervention, allows to take actions based on the decided parameters and keeps the entire building connected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients don&#8217;t want to compromise their health due to any global health crisis. So, it has become essential for hospitals and clinics to do everything possible to provide a smooth experience for their patients and efficient internal processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide these, there&#8217;s nothing better than IoT.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambient Sensors: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sensors gather information about the hospital environment, like temperature, humidity, and air quality. This data can be used to maintain a comfortable and secure environment for patients and staff. It can also help identify potential issues like leaks or equipment malfunctions.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Sensors: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart hospital solutions might use a variety of other sensors, including those implanted in patients for specific purposes. These sensors can monitor things like glucose levels in diabetic patients or pressure in patients with certain medical conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sensors collectively form the device layer of a smart hospital&#8217;s IoT infrastructure, playing a crucial role in gathering data that can be analyzed and utilized to improve patient care, operational efficiency, and overall hospital management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transferring data between devices and the main system can be tricky. Since these devices send data constantly, it piles up on servers, causing storage and management issues. Plus, there can be delays between devices and the main server where AI processes the data. If every decision relies on sending data back and forth, it takes time. To solve this, many hospitals use Edge devices. These are smart IoT devices that can make some decisions on their own. This helps reduce delays and improve efficiency.</span></p>

<h3><b>Network Layer</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The network layer deals with how devices talk to each other and far-away servers. It decides which network rules and radio technology to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The back-end is mostly made of servers. These servers can be nearby or far away. Devices talk to far-away servers to save data and get instructions. The server also holds the user app, which we&#8217;ll talk about later. Many prefer cloud IoT systems over local servers because they&#8217;re cheaper, and users don&#8217;t have to look after them.</span></p>
<h3><b>Application Layer</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To run smart hospital solutions smoothly, you&#8217;ll need a good IoT hospital management app. This app layer includes all the software needed to manage the hospital smartly. It works on servers, letting users check real-time data from devices, control devices from far away, and get important insights. With AI&#8217;s help, managers can spot trends and get advice on making the hospital work better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s now look at some of the best practices that can be considered for </span>custom enterprise software development<span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<h2><strong>Adhere to Agile Development Methodologies</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile development methodologies, like </span>Scrum or Kanban,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> promote flexibility, iterative development, and continuous improvement. By embracing agile practices, development teams can adapt to changing needs and deliver incremental value to stakeholders.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Regularly Test and Validate the Software</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing a robust testing strategy throughout the development lifecycle is essential. This includes unit, integration, and user acceptance testing. Regularly testing and validating the software helps identify and resolve issues promptly, ensuring a high-quality end product.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Integrate Security Throughout the Development Process</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is a critical aspect of </span>custom enterprise software development<span style="font-weight: 400;">. By integrating security practices throughout the development process, such as secure coding techniques, regular security audits, and adherence to industry standards, vulnerabilities can be minimized, and data can be protected.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Provide Adequate Documentation and Training</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comprehensive documentation of the software architecture, design, and functionalities is crucial for maintaining the software&#8217;s long-term maintainability. Additionally, providing training resources and user manuals helps end-users effectively utilize the software and ensures a smooth adoption process.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Utilize Continuous Integration and Deployment</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate build, testing, and deployment processes. This approach ensures faster and more reliable software releases, enabling teams to respond quickly to changes and deliver updates efficiently.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Monitor and Analyze User Feedback</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting and analyzing user feedback systematically is invaluable in improving the software&#8217;s performance and user experience.

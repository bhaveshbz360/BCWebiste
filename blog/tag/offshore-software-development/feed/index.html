<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s begin by understanding what exactly Agile software development is and how adopting Agile principles can significantly reduce time to market, give businesses a competitive edge, and reduce time to market to drive success.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Agile Software Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile methodology is defined as the popular approach in the field of software development that mainly focuses on collaboration, flexibility, and customer-centricity. It focuses on iterative progress through small, manageable increments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/on-demand-teams/why-startups-choose-dedicated-teams-for-agile-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">dedicated Agile teams</a></strong> to adapt to changing requirements &amp; deliver value to customers more quickly &amp; efficiently.</span></p>
<h3><b>Key Principles &amp; Values of Agile</b><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-41126" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile.png" alt="Key Principles &amp; Values of Agile" width="748" height="397" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-300x159.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-768x407.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the list of key principles involved in Agile software development:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Iterative Development:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Agile methodology promotes breaking down the software development process into smaller i.e. iterative sprints or iterations. Each iteration involves designing, planning, developing, and testing a small functionality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Collaboration: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Agile&#8217;s core values is fostering close collaboration among cross-functional teams. Developers, testers, designers, and stakeholders work together during the entire project. They also ensure everyone is aligned &amp; contribute expertise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile teams often adjust their plans quickly and priorities as project requirements evolve based on customer feedback or market changes. This type of flexibility helps respond to new insights without disrupting the overall project flow.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Focus on Customers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Agile emphasizes delivering value to the customer. Agile teams also ensure that the final software product meets users&#8217; needs &amp;expectations. This iterative feedback loop helps refine features and functionalities based on real-world usage and feedback.</span></li>

<h3><b>Comparison with Traditional Software Development Methods</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By comparing Agile approach with other traditional methods, it will become clear how Agile&#8217;s adaptive &amp; responsive nature can accelerate time to market. This will ensure that the software effectively meets user needs &amp; market demands.</span></p>
<p><b>1. <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/agile-vs-waterfall-which-software-methodology-is-best-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Agile vs Waterfall</a>:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional software development methods i.e. the Waterfall model, follow a linear &amp; sequential approach. Each phase (in terms of requirements, design, development, testing, and rapid deployment) must be completed before moving towards the next. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This further leads to long development cycles and challenges accommodating changes once a phase is completed.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Predictability vs. Flexibility:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">While traditional methods offer predictability &amp; structured planning, they often lack the flexibility to adapt to these changes. Conversely, Agile embraces change &amp; uncertainty. This allows teams to pivot and make adjustments as needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes Agile particularly well-suited for projects with evolving requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Feedback Cycles:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In traditional methods, feedback typically comes late in the process, often during the testing phase or after deployment. Agile incorporates regular feedback throughout the development cycle, enabling continuous improvement and early identification of issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reduces the risk of major problems emerging late in the project.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Importance of Time to Market for Businesses</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a flexible framework, <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>custom mobile app development</strong></a> software can scale alongside the growth of a business. Custom software can handle more users, transactions, or data without slowing down. This means it stays strong and dependable even as the business grows, laying a solid foundation for long-term success.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Enhanced Flexibility for Agility</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software lets businesses change and grow as per the market. They can add, change, or remove features easily, keeping up with what customers want. This flexibility helps businesses grab new opportunities and change their strategies quickly, staying innovative and competitive.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Seamless Integration with Existing Systems</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software fits smoothly with other systems of business, making everything work together better. This means data and communication flow easily between different parts of the organization, breaking down barriers and making things run more smoothly. With everything connected, teams can work together more easily, saving time and effort and making the whole business more efficient.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Cost Efficiency in the Long Run</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although custom software development might seem more expensive at first compared to off-the-shelf options, it can save a lot of money in the long run. With custom software, businesses don&#8217;t have to pay expensive fees for licenses as they do with other software. Plus, they don&#8217;t have to rely on outside companies for help or maintenance as much, which also saves money over time.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Competitive Advantage through Differentiation</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software helps businesses stand out in the market by offering special features, personalized experiences, and new ideas. This makes customers want to choose them over other companies and keeps them coming back. By using custom software to provide excellent service and value, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and keep growing successfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By investing in custom software, companies can improve their operations, be more flexible, and do better than their competition in today&#8217;s changing business world.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Considerations When Developing Custom Software</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When planning to develop custom software, it&#8217;s important to think about a few key things to make sure it turns out well. Here are some important factors to think about:</span><b></b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40693" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development.png" alt="Key Considerations of Custom Software development" width="860" height="715" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development-300x249.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development-768x639.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development-480x399.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Clear Understanding of Requirements</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting the software development process, it&#8217;s crucial to understand its purpose thoroughly. This involves extensive discussions with stakeholders to determine their needs and expectations. Gathering this information upfront ensures the software will meet all the organization&#8217;s requirements and goals.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Budgeting and Resource Allocation</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making custom software takes a lot of time and money. It&#8217;s important to set a budget that makes sense and use resources well to keep the project on schedule and meet its goals on time. By being careful with how money and time are spent, organizations can avoid spending more than planned and make sure the project goes well.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Choosing the Right Development Partner</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right company to build the software is really important for the project to go well. Find a company that&#8217;s well-known for making good custom software. Consider points like how much they know, how long they&#8217;ve been doing it, and if they fit well with your organization&#8217;s way of doing things. A reliable company can offer helpful insights, advice, and support, ensuring smooth and successful results.</span><b></b></p>

<hr />
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Technology Stack</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking the right tools and technology is another important consideration. Choose the ones that match the project&#8217;s needs, like how big it might get and what it needs to do in the future. Also, think about ease of integration, security, and support, when evaluating technology options. By using the right technology, organizations can make strong, flexible software that works well now and in the future.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Agile Development Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using agile methods while making custom software can keep the project flexible and ready to change if needed. Agile development in software engineering encourages working together, being open, and making things better bit by bit. This means the software can get better quickly and be ready to use sooner. By being agile, organizations can listen to feedback, fix things that aren&#8217;t right, and make sure the software does what people need it to do.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Testing and Quality Assurance</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thorough <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-quality-assurance-testing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software testing and QA services</a></strong> are essential factors of the custom enterprise software development process. Use strong testing methods to find and fix any bugs, errors, or usability issues before launching the software to real potential users. By emphasizing quality assurance throughout the development process, organizations can be sure that the final product meets the ultimate standards of performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software development has become increasingly complex in today&#8217;s rapidly evolving digital landscape. Organizations strive to build robust and scalable applications while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing market demands. This is where microservices architecture comes into play, revolutionizing how software is designed, developed, and deployed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a recent survey by </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1236823/microservices-usage-per-organization-size/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was found that a staggering 85% respondents from large organizations with 5,000 or more employees reported the utilization of microservices in their operations. This statistic emphasizes the growing recognition of the benefits and necessity of adopting a microservices architecture among larger enterprises.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-32321 aligncenter" title="share of respondents" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/share-of-respondents.png" alt="share of respondents" width="809" height="509" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/share-of-respondents.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/share-of-respondents-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s blog will delve into microservices architecture and explore the </span>advantages of microservices<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and how they can boost scalability and flexibility in software development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will uncover the fundamental principles of microservices, their challenges, and considerations of their implementation. Furthermore, we will provide valuable insights and best practices to guide you in harnessing the power of microservices to build resilient, scalable, and adaptable software solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s uncover the transformative potential of microservices’ architecture in revolutionizing modern software development.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Understanding Microservices Architecture</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microservices architecture is a modern approach to developing software that focuses on breaking down complex applications into smaller, independent services. Each service is responsible for a particular business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This architectural style promotes modularity, flexibility, and scalability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations can achieve greater agility by seeking </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software development consulting</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> microservices services, as different teams can work on separate services simultaneously. Each service can be developed using different technologies or programming languages, allowing teams to leverage the best tools for the task at hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microservices communicate with each other through lightweight protocols like REST or message queues, enabling loose coupling and easy integration. This architecture also facilitates scaling individual services based on demand, allowing organizations to handle varying workloads more efficiently.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Freelancing Software Development</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rise of </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/digital-transformation-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">digital transformation</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many companies are turning to freelancers to leverage the agility that comes with this type of model.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downside of freelancing software development is that it may need more quality assurance measures offered by a </span>software outsourcing service firm<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Additionally, freelancers often need more institutional knowledge that can be acquired from an established team working in-house. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Pros</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following are the pros of freelancing software development that can support your project positively:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Cost</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Freelance software developers often charge much lower rates than in-house or outsourcing firms. This is a plus point for companies seeking affordable options for their smaller projects.  </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><b>Specialization</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Another benefit of in-house software outsourcing is the specialized knowledge of freelance developers in diverse areas and &amp; technologies, so you can choose the exact skillset you need for each project.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><b>Flexibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: You can hire freelancers, allowing you to quickly scale up and down as required. This means you don&#8217;t have to commit to hiring additional personnel or expensive contracts.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">      4 </span><b>Time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Freelance developers often work more efficiently than in-house or outsourced employees, allowing them to get the job done quickly without compromising on quality.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Cons</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With pros, Freelancing comes with specific cons that put a business in dilemma whether they should vouch for this service. Let&#8217;s check them out!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lack of control</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Since there will be no in-house team, companies usually have less control over the project, say in the direction it takes. Also, if your freelancer works remotely, it can be harder to ensure that the project meets its goals. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lack of collaboration: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with a team of</span> a software outsourcing service company<span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows everyone to communicate and collaborate, which can lead to better results. But freelance developers don&#8217;t get this kind of team dynamic when working with a freelancer.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Issue of Reliability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There can be an issue of reliability with freelancers sometimes, especially if they&#8217;re juggling multiple projects. If the freelancer disappears or falls behind schedule, it could mean significant delays for your project. This could cost you time and money in the long run. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Limited networking opportunities:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Freelancers may miss out on networking opportunities that come with working in a traditional company, which can be essential for building professional relationships and staying current with industry developments.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong> Which Software Development Service is Best?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best </span>software development service <span style="font-weight: 400;">depends on your company&#8217;s needs. In-house software development is ideal for companies that need a highly specialized and dedicated team that can provide expert-level guidance and knowledge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing is best for companies that need access to global talent and expertise but need more money or resources to bring it in-house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing is an excellent way for companies to quickly scale their operations and gain access to specialized skills without breaking the bank.</span></p>
<p>Many considerable software outsourcing companies in India, like ValueCoders, help <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/saas-consulting-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">businesses with SAAS development </a>and other software development services.  They have a team of skilled developers with years of coding experience, so connecting with them would lead you to positive results.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Words</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today there are countless options available for businesses for software development. However, the major ones include in-house, outsourcing, and freelancing. Each option has pros and cons, and it is up to the company to decide which best suits its requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter which option you select, you must ensure you select a reliable &amp; experienced</span><b><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=Webblog-29114&amp;utm_medium=Anu_B11&amp;utm_id=Softwaredevelopment" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> software outsourcing service company</a>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This will ensure that your project is delivered on time &amp; up to the quality standards.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrying out software development in a foreign country halfway across the globe, and entrusting important projects to unknown individuals, sounded crazy not long ago. But a few businesses attempted it and they struck gold. Most of us would never have imagined that developing economies such as India, China, and the Philippines would ‌be a gold mine for some of the world&#8217;s most successful countries. It all started as an experiment and then turned into one of the most popular practices in software development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore software development gives access to cheaper yet effective solutions from areas of the world where operating costs are much lower than in the west. This is because labor rates in countries like India and China are much lower than in developed countries. Offshore development also gives companies access to a global talent pool. This is especially beneficial for businesses with limited resources or those that need to quickly ramp up their development capacity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, it&#8217;s not that easy. There are many things involved in making this lucrative and viable operation a success. This whitepaper will discuss these issues and present their solution to you understandably.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolution Of Offshore Software Development</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of offshore software development originated in the early days of computing when companies would contract out work to programmers in India and other countries to take advantage of lower labor costs. However, this practice was not widely adopted until the 1990s, when advances in telecommunications technology made it possible for companies to collaborate with service providers located around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, developed countries were a relatively untapped resources for software development, and companies were able to get quality work at a fraction of the cost of hiring programmers in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, offshore software development is a popular way for companies to cut costs and improve efficiency. By outsourcing work to a low-cost provider, businesses can save money on wages and benefits while still maintaining control over quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore software development has continued to grow in popularity as more and more companies realize the potential cost savings. Additionally, many offshore development firms have worked hard to improve their quality and customer service, making them a more attractive option for businesses. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputed global companies such as Intel, American Express, Aetna, U.S. Healthcare, Compaq, General Motors, Home Depot, IBM, Microsoft, Motorola Shell, and 3M have set up their own offshore software development centers or entered ‌strategic alliances with off shore software companies.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore Resources Hiring Models</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25878 size-full" title="offshore and onshore" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186033.png" alt="Hiring models of Offshore Resource" width="549" height="288" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186033.png 549w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186033-300x157.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore outsourcing, often shortened as just outsourcing, is when a company moves its business process to a country that is not geographically located nearby.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Team Augmentation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary offshore resources hiring model is the team augmentation model. This model involves bringing on contractors for only a specific amount of time and often for just a specific project or tasks that are needed to be done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To effectively execute the team augmentation hiring strategy, employers should look for individuals with skill sets that are well suited for their needs, but not necessarily any resources who possess in-depth knowledge of the business or industry they’re working within. This ensures they’ll have the flexibility they need when it comes time to move on from their contracting employees.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Onsite/Offshore</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The onsite/offshore model is a way of organizing work in which some tasks are performed on-site, while others are performed off-site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work is first divided into two categories: tasks that can be performed on-site, and tasks that must be performed off-site. On-site work is typically done by employees of the company itself, while off-site work is subcontracted to another firm. </span></p>
<p><strong>This arrangement can offer several advantages </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it can save money. Employees working on-site usually cost more than those working off-site, so by outsourcing some tasks, companies can reduce their labor costs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, it gives organizations the ability to tap into a global pool of talent. This can be especially beneficial for companies that cannot find the talent they need locally. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, it leads to improved efficiency and productivity by leveraging the best practices of both onshore and offshore.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Pure Offshore</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term &#8220;pure offshore model&#8221; refers to a business arrangement in which all aspects of the work are carried out offshore, with no onshore involvement‌. In this type of arrangement, a company contracts with another company (or individual) to have certain work tasks performed by the second company (or individual). The key characteristic of an offshore model is that the work is contracted to be performed outside of the contracting party&#8217;s home country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of a company that employs a pure offshore model is ValueCoders, an Indian IT services company. ValueCoders offers its services to clients around the world, but all of its operations are based in India. This allows the company to take advantage of lower labor costs in India while still being able to serve clients in developed markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several advantages that can come from using a pure offshore model. First, it can save businesses a significant amount of money, as they don&#8217;t need to pay for onshore talent or resources. Second, it can help businesses tap into global expertise and perspectives, as they&#8217;re not limited to working with an onshore team. And third, it allows businesses to move faster with faster turnaround times.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Offsite/Offshore</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The offsite/offshore model involves having your company’s software written by a team of programmers who work from home or in a remote office location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has two main benefits over onsite employment models: lower overhead costs (no physical offices or large teams of employees) and speedier development times (some firms report 2-3x faster product time-to-market). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, offsite work comes with its own set of risks, which includes difficulties in communication, language barriers, and sometimes fraud. Because of these risks, some companies choose to hire firms that are regulated by either local government or industry associations. If you decide offshore is right for your business or project needs, we recommend finding an expert advisor before entering ‌any agreement.</span></p>
<h2>Why You Should Go For Offshore Resources Hiring?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25881 size-full" title="Group 186129" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186129.png" alt="Global data of Offshore Resource" width="538" height="628" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186129.png 538w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186129-257x300.png 257w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should go for offshore resources hiring if you&#8217;re trying to get your business started up quickly and efficiently. The offshore model can be extremely cost-effective since you won&#8217;t have to worry about covering any overhead costs associated with setting up an in-house team. This type of arrangement also helps improve communication and collaboration between your teams, since they&#8217;ll no longer be working in silos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, if you choose to work with a reputable offshore partner like ValueCoders you can be confident that your project will be in expert hands. Below mentioned are a few reasons ‌you should go for offshore resources hiring.</span></p>
<h3><strong>High Cost Of Local Developers And State Compliance</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring local developers turns out to be more expensive for companies than offshore developers. There are multiple reasons that work behind this‌. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, the cost of living in developed countries is ‌higher than in developing countries. This means that developers in developed countries will need to earn higher salaries just to maintain their standard of living.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed countries often have stricter laws and regulations around employment, including things like minimum wage laws and employee benefits. This can add significant costs to hiring local developers compared to hiring offshore developers who may not be subject to the same laws and regulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, developed countries have a more sophisticated and complex economy, so businesses operating in these countries will ‌need more expensive developers with more specialized skill sets. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25883 size-full" title="Group 186037" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186037.png" alt="Benefits of Offshore Resource" width="497" height="437" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186037.png 497w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186037-300x264.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px" /></p>
<h3><strong>A Dearth Of The Required Skill Set</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lack of the required skillset locally can make businesses look to hire offshore developers. For example, if a business needs a software developer with expertise in a certain programming language that is not widely taught in the United States, they may have to look overseas for a developer who is fluent in that language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One main reason is that the demand for developers with specific skills continues to grow, while the number of domestic candidates possessing these skills remains relatively static. And when you factor in the high cost of salaries and benefits for developers in the U.S., it becomes clear why so many companies are turning to outsourcing as a viable option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many offshore developers are willing to work for less money than their on-shore counterparts, which can save business money in the long run. Outsourcing development work in countries like India or Russia can be up to 50 percent cheaper than hiring domestically.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Unable To Scale And Expand Business Offerings</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses often turn to offshore developer hiring in order to expand their business offerings. By working with developers ‌in other countries, a business can gain access to new technologies, programming languages, and software that they may not have otherwise had access to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By working with an offshore development team, a business can often save money on labor costs. This is because the cost of living and doing business in certain parts of the world is much lower than it is in North America or Europe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore developer hiring can help businesses scale their operations by giving them access to a wider pool of talent at a lower cost.</span></p>
<p class="imgtrigger" style="cursor: pointer;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25899 size-full" title="Whitepaper CTA 3" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Whitepaper-CTA-3.jpg" alt="Whitepaper CTA 3" width="1600" height="368" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Whitepaper-CTA-3.jpg 1600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Whitepaper-CTA-3-300x69.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Whitepaper-CTA-3-1024x236.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Whitepaper-CTA-3-768x177.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Whitepaper-CTA-3-1536x353.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h3><strong>High Infrastructure Cost</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore developer hiring can help reduce infrastructure costs in a few ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, by outsourcing development work to a lower-cost country, businesses can often save money on the salaries of the developers who will work on your project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using an offshore development team, businesses may ‌reduce or eliminate the need for certain types of infrastructure and support staff in their own office. This can include anything from dedicated server space and IT support to administrative and HR staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, offshoring also helps take advantage of new technology that would otherwise be too expensive or difficult to implement in the office. By working with a development team that is already using the latest tools and technologies, you can avoid the extra cost of introducing them into the system. </span></p>
<h2><strong>How To Integrate The Offshore Resources With Your Organization</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few different ways to integrate offshore resources with your organization:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25884 size-full" title="Group 186041" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186041.png" alt="Group 186041" width="550" height="313" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186041.png 550w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186041-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few ways agile can help remote teams integrate offshore developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using an agile framework, you can ensure that everyone is always on the same page, which eliminates any miscommunications or misunderstandings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using agile allows for more frequent communication and collaboration between team members, both in-office and offshore. This builds better working relationships and helps ensure that all team members agree development-wise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, using agile also enables tracking progress more closely and identifying potential roadblocks or issues sooner rather than later. This allows for rapid course corrections and keeps the project on track. Overall, agile can be a great tool for managing remote teams &#8211; including those with offshore developers. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Using Tools To Manage Remote Teams</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several tools out there that can help you manage and integrate an offshore developer into your team. For example, tools like Trello or Asana can help you keep track of tasks and projects, and enable remote communication between team members. Skype or Slack can be used for messaging and file sharing and tools like Google Hangouts or Zoom can be used for video conferencing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is to find the right tools that work for your team and your project, and then to make sure everyone is familiar with how to use them. By using a variety of tools for communication and collaboration, you can create a smooth workflow for your entire team &#8211; both on-site and offshore.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Project Management Tools</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project management tools are software applications that help you plan, track, and report on your projects. They can ‌communicate project information to team members, manage project tasks and deadlines, and control costs. Some popular project management tools include Microsoft Project, Basecamp, and Trello. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project management tools can be extremely helpful in managing complex projects with many moving parts. They can help you keep track of what needs to be done, when it needs to be done, and who is responsible for each task. They can also help you identify potential risks or issues and track progress‌. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of project management tools available to help you plan, track, and execute projects. Here are a few popular options:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trello is a web-based project management tool that uses Kanban-style boards to visually aid in task management. It’s great for small projects with a few team members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asana is a web and mobile application that allows users to create and manage tasks and projects. It offers features such as Gantt charts and integration with third-party apps. Asana is better suited for larger projects with more complex workflows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basecamp is another web-based project management tool that focuses on simplifying communication</span></p>
<h4><strong>Productivity Management Tools</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity management is a process that helps you and your team identify areas where productivity can be improved, set goals and objectives for improving productivity, and track progress‌. Productivity management can be divided into project management, time management, and task management.</span></p>
<p><b>Project management software</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is helpful for people who need to track deadlines and deliverables for work or personal projects. Examples of project management software include Trello, Asana, and Basecamp.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Communication Tools</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to integrate offshore developers into your company is to use communication tools that allow for collaboration and transparency. Some great tools for this include Slack, Google Hangouts, and Trello. These platforms allow for easy messaging and sharing of files, which makes it easy for developers to stay in touch and work together on projects. Having a continuous flow of communication is key to keeping offshore developers integrated into your company culture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several communication tools to integrate the offshore developers in an organization. The most common ones are email, chat, and video conferencing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email is the most basic and commonly used tool for communication between organizations. It is quick and easy to use, and can ‌send messages to multiple people at once. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chat is another common communication tool, which can be used for real-time conversations between two or more people. We often use it for shorter conversations than email, and can be a more informal way of communicating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video conferencing is a tool that allows two or more people to communicate via webcam. This can be useful for meetings or presentations. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Hurdles to Overcome In Hiring Offshore Resources</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many potential hurdles that companies must overcome when hiring offshore resources. These can include language barriers, cultural differences, time zone differences, and communication difficulties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies must ensure that their employees are legally allowed to work in the country where they will be based and that they have the ‌visas and work permits. Finally, companies need to evaluate the cost-benefit of hiring offshore resources, as these employees may require higher wages than local employees.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Country Related Hurdles</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top three country related hurdles that companies face when looking to hire offshore developers are cultural differences, communication barriers, and time-zone differences.</span></p>
<p><b>Cultural Differences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: It&#8217;s difficult to find a developer who is culturally compatible with your company. </span></p>
<p><b>Communication Barriers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The language barrier can be a major obstacle when trying to communicate with potential developers. </span></p>
<p><b>Time-Zone Differences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: It&#8217;s difficult to coordinate meeting times and communicate effectively across different time zones.</span></p>
<p><b>There are several ways to overcome these hurdles:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Cultural Compatibility</b>: Look for a development firm that has cultural values that are aligned with your company&#8217;s values.</li>
<li><b> Communication Tools</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Use online communication tools such as chat, video conferencing, and project management software to help</span></li>
<li><b> Different Time Zones</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Setting a work schedule in which all team members can participate.</span></li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Firm Related Issues</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>False claims of companies for their developers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many firms claim to have experience in various technologies, but it&#8217;s found out they&#8217;re all just fake.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to overcome such issues?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no substitute for looking at the actual work when assessing programming abilities, project management skills, or written English command. A development organization in any nation should be proud to exhibit prospective customers&#8217; samples of their work and internal processes to potential clients.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of direct control</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outsourcing firm lacks direct control over the offshore team. As a result, constant oversight of the job will be impossible, as opposed to internal development.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to overcome this problem?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appoint a senior executive to handle all phases of outsourcing. In remote outsourcing, developing a long-term relationship with the vendor is critical. If there&#8217;s only one point of contact within the firm, trust levels rise.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Team Related Problems</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Lack of understanding by offshore employees</strong></p>
<p><b>How to overcome this problem?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an onsite coordinator makes it easier for the client and the offshore team to communicate. The onsite coordinator ensures that the offshore team clearly understands the customer&#8217;s demands. He acts as a go-between, ensuring that any language or cultural gaps are bridged.</span></p>
<p><strong>Misunderstandings And Poor Documentation Due To Different Native Language</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">English is an official language in India, Ireland, and a few other well-known offshore nations. You may count on a strong understanding of idiomatic English in those nations. In other areas, you must ensure that there is mutual communication.</span></p>
<h2>Maximizing the ROI With Offshore Resources</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking to maximize the ROI with the offshore resources, there are a few things to keep in mind:</span></em></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make sure you are taking advantage of the cost savings offered by offshore resources. Outsourcing lower-level tasks or processes that don&#8217;t require a high level of expertise can often do this.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use only the correct resources for the job. Not all offshore resources are equal, and you may find that certain countries or regions offer a higher quality of labor at a lower cost. Do your research and make sure you are getting the most bang for your buck.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Establish good communication channels with your offshore team and make sure everyone is on the same page.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make sure you have a clear and well-defined project roadmap. This will help ensure everyone agrees and understands the goals of the project.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Establish clear expectations for what each team handles. This will help avoid any confusion or miscommunication between teams.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clearly define deadlines and make sure everyone is aware of them. This will help ensure that projects stay on track and don&#8217;t get delayed unnecessarily.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Compare the cost of labor in your country with the cost of labor in other countries. If the cost of labor is much lower in another country, it may be more cost-effective to outsource work to that country.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Evaluate the quality of work that you can expect from offshore resources. If you can find a provider who offers high-quality work at a cheap price, it may be worth outsourcing work to that provider.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Top Technologies For Which Companies Prefer Offshore Resources Hiring</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of popular software technologies for which companies often prefer to hire offshore developers. Some of the most common technologies include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing technologies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-platform and hybrid deployment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processes build under Angular, React, NodeJS</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data computation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile app development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web development</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Ways to Identify the Best Company for Offshore Hiring</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few ways to identify the best company for offshore resources hiring</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25891 size-full" title="Group 186131" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186131.png" alt="Group 186131" width="547" height="369" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186131.png 547w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Group-186131-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Communication and Coordination</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that there is clear and effective communication between the in-house team and the offshore developers. This includes clearly communicating your expectations, goals, and feedback. There should also be a system in place for regular updates and progress reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coordination is another important factor. There should be a clear process for how work will be assigned, how deadlines will be set, and how issues will be resolved. This can help prevent misunderstandings and potential scope creep.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Outsourcing Rates</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, it&#8217;s important to understand the point of outsourcing rates. When you outsource your development work, you&#8217;re essentially paying someone else to do the work for you at a lower cost. This can be a great way to save money on your project, but it&#8217;s important to make sure that you&#8217;re comparing apples to apples when assessing different quotes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking to outsource your development, it&#8217;s important to compare pricing models and find the one that best suits your needs. Typically, you can choose between two different models:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Pay Per-Hour Rate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; This is the most common model, where you pay a developer an hourly rate for their time. This can be a good option if you need a lot of flexibility or if you&#8217;re unsure of how much work will be required. It can also be more expensive in the long run if you go over your budget.</span></li>
<li><b>Pay for Milestones </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; With this model, you pay for specific milestones rather than hours worked. This can be more cost-effective in the long run.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Project Management</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best company for offshore developer hiring like <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>ValueCoders</strong></a> will have a robust project management process in place. This process should include requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment. By having a well-defined project management process in place, the company can ensure that the developers they hire are working on the correct tasks and that it keeps all stakeholders informed of progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking for a company to hire offshore developers, it&#8217;s important to find one that has a good project management system in place. This way, you&#8217;ll be able to track the progress of your project and ensure that it&#8217;s on schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project management is essential for ensuring that your project completes on time, within budget, and to your specifications. A good project manager will work with you to create a detailed plan for your project and will then ensure that we complete all aspects of the project on time and within budget.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some things to look for in a company&#8217;s project management system include:</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Clear communication channels between the client and developer team</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Frequent status updates from the developers so you know what&#8217;s been accomplished and what still needs to be done</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Proper documentation of all tasks and procedures, so there is no confusion about what needs to be done or how it should be done</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for everyone involved in the project</span></p>

<h3><strong>Size of Organization</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be difficult to identify the best company for offshore hiring, as there are many factors to consider. One important factor to consider is the size of the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore outsourcing can be a great way to save money and improve efficiency, but it&#8217;s important to work with a company that has the resources and infrastructure in place to handle your project. A large, well-established company will have more experience and expertise in offshore outsourcing than a smaller company. They will also have the bandwidth to take on additional projects without compromising quality or service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re looking for a reliable partner for offshore hiring, look for a company with a proven track record and extensive experience in the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smaller companies may be more affordable, but they may not have as much experience or resources in place for offshore hiring. It&#8217;s important to do your research before deciding and to ask plenty of questions to make sure you&#8217;re finding the best fit for your needs.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Availability Of Skilled Resources And Expertise</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the availability of skilled resources, it is important to consider both the current skill set of the developers you are considering and also their future potential. Regarding expertise, you will want to evaluate developers on their ‌experience and track record. In both cases, it is important to hire developers who can show they have the right skill set and experience for your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to identify the best company for offshore developer hiring is therefore to talk to several companies and ask them about their developers&#8217; skillsets and experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few tips for finding the best company for offshore developer hiring: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Look for a company with a strong portfolio of work. This will give you a good indication of their level of expertise and skill. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make sure they have experience working with clients in your domain.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>IP and Data Security</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To hire an offshore developer, it&#8217;s important to identify a company that will provide you with the best possible IP and data security. Here are a few factors to consider when making your decision: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make sure the company has a robust IP and data security protocol in place. Offshore companies should have clearly defined procedures for handling confidential information. These procedures should be regularly reviewed and updated in response to changes in technology and data security threats.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Choose a company that is ‌in a country with laws that protect your intellectual property rights. Countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia have laws that offer powerful protection for intellectual property.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The company&#8217;s staff should be fully trained in data security best practices and regularly updated on new threats and vulnerabilities.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking the time to research potential providers, you can ensure that your intellectual property and sensitive data are well-protected.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Project Delivery Approach</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Project Delivery Approach is defined as the way in which a project intended to create or deliver a product, service or result is managed and undertaken by an organization. It includes multiple contractual agreements between a variety of stakeholders, including designers, manufacturers, suppliers, customers and end users. There are three main types of Project Delivery Approaches: Agile,Iterative, and Waterfall. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Knowledge Retention Approach</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach ensures that the developer has a good understanding of your company&#8217;s unique knowledge domain and can apply it to his work. Without this approach, developers may not be able to properly adapt their skills and experience to your company&#8217;s needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to find out if a developer has a good understanding of the Knowledge Retention Approach is to ask them about it during the interview process. If they&#8217;re able to explain it clearly and show how they would use it in their work, then you can be confident that they&#8217;ll be able to do a great job for your company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knowledge retention approach is based on ensuring that crucial project requirements and details are accurately conveyed to, and understood by, the team carrying out the work. To do this, an organization or individual first needs to understand what needs to be accomplished. They will also need to have excellent communication skills in order to explain the project requirements to those who will work on it. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>38% of small businesses currently outsource a business process.  This percentage is set to increase as we are about to move into 2023. There is a multitude of reasons which you can find online on why you should outsource your business development needs to a custom software development company.</p>
<p>Outsourcing custom software development to the right vendor can significantly reduce development costs and decrease the workload on your employees.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a great number of advantages, there are some significant pitfalls that businesses often make while outsourcing, which can result in failures, additional costs, and time loss.</span></p>
<h2>Five Things to Avoid When Outsourcing Software Development:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1.Lack of Comprehensive Research</strong></h3>
<p>Selecting a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=custom_13052_a24&amp;utm_campaign=SME" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">Custom Software Development Company</a> without conducive research is one of the major pitfalls that businesses make. Most startups base their outsourcing decision solely on the basis of cost-efficiency.</p>
<p>Although the cost factor plays an important role in the decision-making process, it is not the only one. Other things that must be taken into consideration include &#8211; a company’s portfolio, and expertise, feedback and reviews, and the way your outsourcing partner functions on the market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple of areas that you should research to make sure that you have aligned the right outsourcing partner for your next project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll have to dig into the intricate details to know everything that you would like to know such as:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13143 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3.jpg" alt="Questions to ask before Software Outsourcing" width="794" height="514" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3.jpg 794w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-2-3-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /></p>
<p>Principally, a lot of research should be done at the time of the primary interview. The rest will come from real-time communication with your Offshore <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>IT Outsourcing Company</strong></a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, after a thorough and detailed analysis, it becomes much easier to identify whether that team can realize your project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should make up time for research and preparation as its worth it. The time that you have spent on research should be in correlation with the investment size and expected cooperation support that you would like to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your research intricate will depend on your project requirements like for a simple project, you must not invest more than 3-4 months while choosing your next software development company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you need to scale your technical team from 40 to 70 or you have a 3-year roadmap, then you should take your time and do the proper research.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3><b>2. Keeping Ambiguity in Requirements and Miscommunication</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times, small business owners outsource their software development projects without a complete understanding of what needs to be done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, if you have just a vague idea about your project, it becomes quite difficult to set clear requirements for the outsourcing partner, as well as to evaluate whether the process is headed in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few questions that can help you clarify the requirements of your project:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13139 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4.jpg" alt="Requirements for Software Outsourcing" width="794" height="444" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4.jpg 794w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4-768x429.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Featured-4-600x336.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 794px) 100vw, 794px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, before initiating a collaboration you must discuss the milestones and the approval system as well. Your outsourcing vendor must understand exactly what you want in order to find the most effective ways to implement your idea.</span></p>

<h3><b>3. Outsourcing to Companies that are NOT in Sync with Modern Trends and Updates</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing to outdated companies that are not in sync with modern trends can impose troubles in the longer run. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it may seem that you have chosen a</span> web development company<b><i>, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">who can code better than anyone else, they may be using workflows and interfaces specific to their local area. This can cause a significant drift with how end-users will experience your software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No region is worse than others, but it is necessary to check that your outsourcing partner meets your expectations on issues beyond technicalities &#8211; such as legal &amp; compliance risks, working ethics, cultural differences, broadband capacity.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Lack of Basic Tech Expertise at your End</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although outsourcing companies have technical expertise, it doesn’t mean that you presuppose that everything is well aligned at the end of your project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, regular monitoring is important. Lack of technical knowledge at your end may impose some major risks on the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are not in a position to manage projects on your own on a daily basis, then you need to have an internal person or a project manager who can manage and take a consultative approach towards your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opting for such a partner releases you from the pressure of being on your toes with technological upgrades and implementations and also gives you the benefit of leveraging the latest technology for your projects.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. Underestimating the Essence of Quality Assurance or Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing your project while it’s underway is vital for gaining a guarantee that your final project is strong and functions just the way it should. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a tester should be involved in the development process from the very beginning, otherwise, you are likely to encounter tons of bugs in the end. So, ensure that your software is tested appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you’re building, software testing should be an integral part of your software development process from the very beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality Assurance should ideally be done by the same company that collaborates with you for your development projects.</span></p>

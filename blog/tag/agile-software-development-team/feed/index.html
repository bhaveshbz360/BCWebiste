<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Drawbacks of Node.js</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some of the disadvantages of using Node.js are </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Single-Threaded</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Node.js is single-threaded, which limits the number of tasks it can do at once. When dealing with activities that need a lot of CPU power, like encoding videos, this might be a drawback.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Immature Ecosystem</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the sizeable Node.js community, several libraries and modules are still in the early phases of development and may be unstable or lacking in certain features.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Callback Hell</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Node.js&#8217;s asynchronous programming model necessitates the usage of callbacks, which can result in the deep, convoluted code structures known as &#8220;Callback Hell.</p>

This promotes greater operational efficiency and productivity. Take an ERP system, for example, which can simplify financial reports and manage inventories, and a CRM system which allows for more efficient customer data management and engagement. As a result, businesses may minimize costs and generate savings.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3>

An ERP platform, for instance, furnishes real-time inventory records, enabling companies to maximize the effectiveness of their supply chain and trim down their expenses. Likewise, a CRM system reveals insights into customers&#8217; inclinations and tendencies, allowing businesses to customize their services and enhance customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Scalability</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As businesses expand, enterprise software can expand, allowing it to store more data and host more users. This way, organizations can dodge expensive upgrades or total system replacements.</span></p>

This methodology brings together the benefits of web &amp; mobile applications which ultimately results in improved SEO, convenience, and performance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, a Progressive Web App is a website with a similar interface and features as compared to a mobile application.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">Managing a team is not a piece of cake for modern businesses. Focusing on your work while hopping from daily scrum to the next proposed sprint is difficult. Things can anytime go out of control if you don’t have the perfect scrum tools in your hand.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In a rapidly changing business landscape, it’s more important than ever to adapt quickly to new challenges. That’s where agile software development comes in. This methodology prioritizes flexibility and collaboration, allowing businesses to respond quickly to change.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">According to recent survey data collected by <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" data-href="https://1password.com/" data-wpel-link="external">AgileBits</a>, more than 50% of businesses that employ more than 100 people use agile methods. Hence, businesses of all sizes realize the benefits of agile software development, becoming an industry-standard in the modern business world.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">We hope that this blog will make it easy for you to decide and select the best software development methodology for your next project.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But, before we start this journey, it would be wise to have a look at “what is Agile”?</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Agile Software Development: A Brief</h2>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-27798 aligncenter" title="Agile" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Agile.jpg" alt="Agile" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Agile.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Agile-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Agile-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">If we go to the literal meaning of the word “Agile,” then it means — “able to move quickly and easily.” So, the same meaning goes here when we talk about agile regarding software development or project management.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agile is a project management methodology primarily used by a custom software development company. It divides the whole task into multiple smaller tasks and combines them with the incremental &amp; short phases of work called sprints.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The main reason behind this approach is early and fast delivery, adaptive planning &amp; frequent reassessment, flexible response to change, and continuous improvement.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">According to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://hygger.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external noreferrer" data-href="https://hygger.io/" data-wpel-link="external">Hygger</a>, “agile projects are 28.0% more successful than traditional projects. Almost 86.0% of 101,5 international software developers use Agile in their work. 71.0% of surveyed companies admitted to using Agile approaches sometimes or always.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Now, I think you have got an idea of Agile, let’s move further.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Why Do Modern Businesses Need Agile Software Development?</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/agile-consulting?utm_source=agile_consulting&amp;utm_medium=9+Reasons+Agile+&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=27760_nky" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Agile software development</a> is here to stay. It is becoming increasingly popular as more businesses realize this approach’s benefits. In today’s fast-paced business world, agility is key. It provides organizations with thethe flexibility and adaptability to compete.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The traditional waterfall approach to software development can often be too slow and inflexible for modern businesses. Agile development teams can work in short sprints to deliver software responsive to changes. This helps businesses avoid the costly and time-consuming process of making major changes to software that has already been developed.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agile development also encourages collaboration between different teams, which helps ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goal. By using agile development, businesses can be more efficient and productive and better compete in today’s market.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">It is the second step in the process and involves coding the software according to the specifications gathered in the first step. This step is essential in ensuring that the software functions correctly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3. Testing</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is the third step in the process and involves testing the software to ensure that it meets the specifications gathered in the first step. This step is vital in ensuring that the software is high quality and meets customer needs.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4. Deployment</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is the fourth and final step in the process and involves putting the software into production. This step is important in ensuring that the software is available to the customer.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">By following these four steps, Agile methodology helps teams to deliver software development projects more seamlessly.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Top 9 Advantages Of Agile Software Development For Modern Businesses</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agile software development has many advantages for modern businesses. It helps businesses respond quickly to market changes, save money by reducing the need for rework, improve customer satisfaction levels, and improve their competitiveness.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Empowers Employees</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Teams are empowered to decide how their work will be accomplished, their tools, and who their customers are. Employees feel a sense of ownership over the product and know they can make changes if needed. Plus, because teams are self-organizing, employees learn new skills and gain experience in areas outside their expertise.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Builds Trust with Customers</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agile software development ensures that the customer is not forgotten and their needs are considered throughout. As a result, customers trust your company and will be more likely to use your<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-strategy-consulting-firms?utm_source=IT_consulting&amp;utm_medium=9+Reasons+Agile+&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=27760_nky" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> IT consulting services</a> or buy your product because they’re confident it will be delivered on time with all of their needs met.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">2) The customer trusts a business more if they know they will be given what was promised</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">3) Helps create a stronger bond between customers and businesses</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">4) Building trust leads to increased sales</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">5) Better relationships with suppliers</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">6) Improved performance</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">7) Better performance creates an incentive for future success</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">8 ) Successful companies attract investment</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">9 ) Investment creates opportunities for expansion</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Increased flexibility</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agile development teams can adapt their plans and processes to accommodate changes in scope or requirements. This makes agile development ideal for fast-paced, ever-changing business environments.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Promotes Continuous Learning</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agile software development is a collaborative process. There will be disagreements and arguments between team members. The key to agile software development is that it helps teams resolve disagreements quickly and efficiently. Ultimately, the best idea wins because all team members are equally invested.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Better Communication Leads</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Communication is key when it comes to software development. A team that communicates well will work more efficiently and effectively. With agile methodology, regular meetings and standups help with this communication. Regular testing also helps identify bugs in the software before they become a major problem.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Not only does this save time and money, but it improves overall customer satisfaction by providing better quality assurance. Other advantages include faster feedback loops, better management of risk, and improved ability to respond to change.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Greater efficiency</strong></p>

<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Enhanced transparency</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agile development teams are more open and transparent than traditional teams, making it easier for stakeholders to see the project’s progress and offer feedback.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Increased stakeholder engagement</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agile development teams typically involve stakeholders more often and at a deeper level than traditional teams, which leads to greater buy-in and ownership of the final product.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Faster time to market</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agile teams can quickly adapt to changes and deliver working solutions incrementally, which means agile projects can get to market faster than traditional waterfall projects.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Lower risk</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agile teams deliver working software early and often, reducing the project’s overall risk. Additionally, agile teams are typically more responsive to changes, reducing risk.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Encourages Feedback from All Roles</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The collaborative nature of agile software development ensures that feedback from all roles is encouraged and welcomed, which leads to better decisions. Feedback can come in many forms, including through informal conversations with team members or formal meetings, but the key is that it’s encouraged constructively.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One way to encourage feedback is by setting up regular retrospectives where team members discuss what went well and what didn’t go so well in their work. And, because agile software development typically involves shorter projects, feedback loops are often tighter than they would be with waterfall-style processes.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1) .NET MVC (Model View Controller):</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the whole globe. During this pandemic, most of the enterprises(small to big) adopted remote working for employees and clients&#8217; safety. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the initial days when the lockdown was announced, many companies have faced various sorts of issues while managing to work from home (WFH). Even still few of the organizations are facing the same problems at the stretch of remote team management.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Challenges to Manage a Remote Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A remote team is a group of experts from different time zones, distinct skills, and different cultures working unitedly on a unified project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, all small, moderate, big enterprises are focusing on adopting remote working as this is beneficial for current and upcoming time. </span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the survey, it has been found that <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>82%</strong> of </span>respondents said that they experience less stress.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Harvard Business Review</a></strong>, <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>87%</strong></span> of respondents feel more connected via remote working.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the team works from the office, then it requires less management effort as a comparison to remote working. While managing the remote team, many challenges come across, and some of the <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/5-strategies-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">remote team management </a></strong>challenges are related to:</span></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2><strong>What Is The Biggest Advantage of Remote Working?</strong></h2>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility not only helps employees, but it also benefits the organizations now you might be thinking how?</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, when the employees are given work flexibility, then they try to complete and deliver the task on time, and this finally increases business productivity.</span></p>

<h2><strong>7 Significant and Efficient Ways To Manage Remote Team</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at some point, working virtually is useful then similarly, it also has few drawbacks like it requires perfect remote team management.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the employee of the company will be productive, then only you will be able to boost the business growth, but for that, it is indispensable to manage the <strong><a href="https://www.workstatus.io/blog/workforce-management/remote-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">remote working</a></strong> properly. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should do a proper module to manage the remote team and work. I have mentioned a few ways that will help you to manage the remote team. </span></p>
<ol style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><strong>Make Use Of Modern Technologies</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Proper Checkment On Punch In and Punch-Out</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Don&#8217;t Let Communication Gap Hamper your Productivity</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Make Sure that Your Team Is Satisfied</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus On Final Result Not on Activity</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arrange Proper Resources</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Offer Flexibility</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Proper Record On Punch In and Punch-Out</strong><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13767 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2.jpg" alt="Punch in &amp; Punch out" width="500" height="300" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2.jpg 500w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you are managing the remote team, then suggest them to make proper punch in and punch out. If you are a team leader, then you should daily check the employees punch in and punch out. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing that does not end here means if in case the employee forgets to make a punch in and punch out then as a leader you should once ask the employee why he/she doesn&#8217;t mark the check-in or check out.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the new member has joined the team, then the management team should accurately provide them guidance related to check-in and check out. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage this process in a proper manner you can also forward a gentle reminder associated with the same task, and for doing this, you can build a group on Skype, Zoom, Google&#8217;s Team Hangouts.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Make Use Of Modern Technologies for remote team management</strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage the <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/dedicated-development-teams?utm_source=remote_team_al&amp;utm_medium=remote_team_wblog&amp;utm_campaign=SME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">remote team</a> </strong>in a good manner, you should keep your team connected, and for this, you can use various communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to make everyone engaged.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On using modern technologies, your team will also be able to explore and learn new technological features. There are numerous tasks like tracking, communicating that can be done quickly while making use of advanced technologies.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Coronavirus pandemic, several companies preferred the custom software for managing and tracking their employee&#8217;s work. This mainly helped team leaders and management as it saved the working time and also allowed them to focus on other important work. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If in case you are also looking forward to developing the custom software for your making remote team management easier, then connect with the leading <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">software outsourcing company</a></strong>. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Don’t Bring Communication Gap &#8211; Stay Connected</strong></h3>
<p><b></b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13768 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3.png" alt="dedicated teams" width="512" height="318" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arranging formal or informal meetings with the team will help you all to get connected. While working remotely, there are so many issues that are faced by the employees, try to fix those issues &amp; queries on video or voice call.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, voice and video call facilities are available mostly on all apps like Skype, Zoom so for arranging the meeting you can use such apps. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling is the best way to interact with the team, and this also helps the team to connect with the leaders directly. So pic your phone or video call rather than emailing.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to communicate on the video call; this will help you in recognizing employee expression, and to know whether the employee and clients are interested in the talk or not.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Make Sure that Your Team Is Satisfied</strong></h3>
<p>Being out of sight, you may address problems in knowing the needs of every employee. But try to understand the same by recognizing the clues given by the employees.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get an effective outcome from the team, leaders should try to fulfill the requirements of the team. If the employee is satisfied, then he/she will only be able to provide an effective result. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase the workflow as a team leader, you should know from which situation the employee is going through.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an employee is encountering any sort of issues that can be resolved from your side, then try to fix the same. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In remote working, employees face various problems like internet issues, lack of communication, etc this can be resolved by providing great IT support, and as a result, you get exceptional remote team management.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Focus On Final Result Not on Activity</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the team is working remotely then focus on the employee&#8217;s work, which means you need to check whether the employee&#8217;s work is productive or not! whether he/she is submitting tasks on time or not! Try not to focus on the activity of the remote employees; it is not possible to trace or track all work activity.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think if employees are completing their tasks on time and offering you valuable work, then its activity hardly matters for the organization. You can also encourage the team members; this will boost team performance.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Arrange Proper Resources</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All employees that work in the organization don&#8217;t have proper working setup (laptop, internet connectivity) back at home. So, as a team leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to arrange the assets for the employees. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the COVID-19 pandemic, many employees faced and even facing issues related to working stations, laptops, active internet, etc. If in case your team members are also confronting the same problem then you should adequately guide him/her to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also connect your team members with the IT team to resolve the technical glitches; this will save your time and will also fix the employee concerning issues faster. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a new member has joined the team then as a team leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to make sure that whether the software and other necessary tools have been correctly installed on the employee work station or not.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Offer Flexibility</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13769 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4.png" alt="Remote Team Management" width="460" height="300" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4.png 460w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team4-300x196.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your team is working remotely, then the company should offer flexibility to the employees, this magnifies the employees work performance and also helps them to deliver the task on time. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are offering flexibility to the employees then as a team leader, you should observe employees&#8217; total working hours.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major drawback of work from home (WFH) is that along with working remotely, you need to manage other tasks also and that this somewhere affects the employee work who are not given the flexibility.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you think that the success of a software development approach project is closely tied to the chosen software development approach?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you heard it right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the different software development methodologies, </span><b><i>Agile and Waterfall are among the most popular </i></b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDLC" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b><i>SDLC methodologies </i></b></a><b><i>in the present.</i></b></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13090 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-vs-waterfall-success-rates-2013-2017_blog-2-1.jpg" alt="Agile Vs Waterfall" width="858" height="503" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-vs-waterfall-success-rates-2013-2017_blog-2-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-vs-waterfall-success-rates-2013-2017_blog-2-1-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-vs-waterfall-success-rates-2013-2017_blog-2-1-768x450.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-vs-waterfall-success-rates-2013-2017_blog-2-1-600x352.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dilemma of choosing the right development methodology is the same with software development teams and entrepreneurs who are always looking out for the right development approach for different projects and businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before digging into the dissimilarities, let us have a closure look at what they are and their strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is Agile Methodology?</strong><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13091 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-738x800-1.png" alt="Agile Methodology" width="493" height="535" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-738x800-1.png 738w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-738x800-1-277x300.png 277w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/agile-738x800-1-600x650.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile methodology focuses on the continuous iteration of development and testing during the entire software development process. This form of SDLC model increases communication among clients, developers, and testers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software development approach was developed by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ambler" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b><i>Scott Ambler</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the autumn of 2000. Though initially dubbed Extreme Modelling (XM) was later renamed as Agile Modelling at the suggestion made by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b><i>Robert Cecil Martin.</i></b></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Agile approach is an iterative and team-based approach to software development. It is a distinct type of Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model. A relatively newer software development model as when one compared to the classic Waterfall Model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you opt for an Agile based development approach, your project is divided, time-boxed, into phases called </span><b><i>sprints.</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every sprint encompasses a defined duration, typically, in weeks, with a list of deliverables that were planned during the start of the sprint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deliverables are prioritized in terms of the business value which is determined by none other than the client(s). The Agile methodology conforms subsequently to a high level of customer involvement throughout the entire software development process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be cases when the planned work for a particular sprint can’t be completed for some reason(s), then, in that case, the entire work will be reprioritized while the information gained is used for the upcoming sprint planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire completed work is evaluated and reviewed by both the project development team and the client. This will be done through daily builds as well as end-of-sprint demos.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waterfall, also known as the traditional approach to software development, the waterfall model follows a linear approach to software development. Because of this, it is also known as the </span><b><i>Linear-Sequential Life Cycle Model.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first description of the Waterfall model was deprived of the word Waterfall, which was first cited in the feature article by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_W._Royce" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b><i>Winston W. Royce</i></b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1970. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is in the year 1976 in which a paper by </span><b><i>Bell and Thaye</i></b><b>r</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is believed to feature the term Waterfall for the very first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Waterfall Model follows a sequential approach, hence the project development team can only move on to the next stage if the previous phase achieves successful completion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile and Waterfall development methodologies are distinct forms of software development methodologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you have a software development project that has evolving or uncertain requirements, then it is ideal for you to use the Agile methodology. On the other hand, if you have smaller software development projects with definite requirements, then you can find the Waterfall model to be your best pick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope that the aforementioned comparison will make it easy for you to make a selection among the two popular SDLC models. </span></p>

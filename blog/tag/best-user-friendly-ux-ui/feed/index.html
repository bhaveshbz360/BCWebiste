										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been estimated that around </span><b>90% of users </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">have stopped using a mobile app because of poor performance. This study has proved that a high-quality user experience (UX) design is no longer a competitive edge alone. Instead, UX is a critical element in ensuring long-term market success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a successful mobile app UI/UX Design, you need to first understand how to resolve the pain points of a user, learn about their latent behaviors, and needs are the only way to ensure exceptional product performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between humans and technology is continuously evolving; however, businesses have to make sure that they emphasize mobile app UI/UX design in their </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that point, companies need to keep abreast of all the latest and emerging UX trends to meet the changing needs of mobile users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the principles of UX design may not change, the trends and techniques certainly do. In this blog, I will try and identify the key UX design trends that will make it big in the year 2022.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Trends in UX Design for 2023</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build a robust application, always use trending things that are liked by users, which helps you to gather mode customers. The application which has a good user interface is usually liked by all. You can also </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>hire mobile app developers</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build a robust mobile app UI/UX design. Let&#8217;s discuss a few mobile app UX design trends.</span></p>
<h3><b>1) Voice Experiences</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14045" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f.png" alt="Mobile app Ideas" width="683" height="513" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f.png 1600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f-300x225.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f-768x576.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f-1536x1152.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands are incorporating voice search technology more in mobile apps, and it&#8217;s the beginning to incorporate vocal user interfaces (VUI). At least, the companies are trying to integrate VUI in some capacity to meet the changing expectations of smartphone users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many roadblocks in the pavement of Voice Search Experiences, and Accessibility issues are the primary concerns as current voice technologies have shown difficulties in accurately identifying instruction where heavy accents or background noise is present.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, a VUI allows actions to be executed based on spoken commands. Changing interfaces requires mobile app designers to abandon old techniques and mindsets for what it means to design a mobile app experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VUIs won&#8217;t entirely take over mobile experiences, though the technology has been showing significant potential for enabling further advancements in consumer AI technologies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">eMarketer,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  there are nearly 150 million smartphone users who will be using Voice Assistants in 2022. </span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emergence of voice technology has given rise to almost 70% of voice searches by 2022.</span></i></span></p>

The trends mentioned in the write-up will offer you leading ideas to develop a top-notch mobile app UI/UX design.</span></p>
<h3><b>2) Designing for Healthier Relationships with Technology</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14044" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1.png" alt="Mobile app - Customer Engagement" width="760" height="308" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1.png 2550w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1-300x122.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1-1024x415.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1-768x311.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1-1536x623.png 1536w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1-2048x830.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is awakening to the need for a mindful relationship with technology. Mobile app users want solutions for their pain areas, but they still want their time off from the app. Instead of fighting for attention, mobile app designers should find relevance and comfort while maintaining a meaningful place in the user&#8217;s daily life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trend is centered around mobile UI/UX designers that need to keep up with the pace of technology to develop healthier habits and design experiences that empower and enable users to achieve their personal goals while respecting their life outside of the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A relevant example that validates the trend above is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram&#8217;s All Caught Up Feature</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The purpose of this feature is to notify users that they have viewed all the recent posts. When users are aware that they&#8217;ve reached the end of their feed, they no longer need to keep scrolling, which saves time and limits distraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS, 2009);</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of Australian users used advanced technologies and social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) in apps to share more information related to education, and this increased the figure by 84% in 2013. It also impacted customer and business relationships</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, along with the time the requirements and demand of the users are increasing to fulfill the same business, they have to change their ways and plan something unique to attract the users; this thing can easily be implemented by developing and using an impactful mobile application.

<h3><b>3) Deeper Personalization with Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine Learning (ML)</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12802" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1.jpg" alt="Mobile user experience" width="702" height="341" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1.jpg 1055w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1-768x374.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1-1024x499.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1-600x292.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year 2022, has marked a substantial growth towards more profound and more sophisticated personalization in mobile UX. As AI and ML continue to take giant leap strides in the ability to understand user behavior and interaction, mobile-based products or apps are becoming more personalized with each passing year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to UX design, the key is to design something flexible as per user preferences and choices. Functionality and in-app content should match user data, such as location, purchase behavior, online communities, events, and personal calendar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of artificial intelligence in mobile apps, and software are increasing day by day, that&#8217;s why </span></i><a style="color: #008000;" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/941835/artificial-intelligence-market-size-revenue-comparisons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide revenue from the AI market</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is projected to reach up to 97.9 billion U.S. dollars by 2023.</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands such as Spotify have already been working on the user&#8217;s playlist&#8217;s customization by curating custom playlists with suggestions based on previous listening behaviors. </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile app developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to tap into AI and ML personalization opportunities as much as possible to supply variable content where appropriate.</span></p>
<h3><b>4) Designing for Consistency between IoT and Wearable Devices with the Cloud</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14048" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Multiexperience-The-Future-of-Mobile-App-Development.jpg" alt="Mobile app related wearable devices" width="694" height="364" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Multiexperience-The-Future-of-Mobile-App-Development.jpg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Multiexperience-The-Future-of-Mobile-App-Development-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Multiexperience-The-Future-of-Mobile-App-Development-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Multiexperience-The-Future-of-Mobile-App-Development-768x403.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the number of IoT and smart devices continue to rise drastically. Users expect seamless integration and responsive design that covers all devices and platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile UX designers need to look at creating integrating experiences between physical design and the functionality of each design as well as interaction design within the whole IoT system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 5G technology, slowly starting to roll out, the more stable network will allow more apps to rely on the cloud.  For mobile app developers, the cloud will be a valuable tool for designing consistency among IoT devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud-based connected devices allow designers to keep all platforms and software up-to-date. As a result, it will provide users with seamless transitions between system elements with minimum effort, adaptation, and wasted time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of usage of wearable devices worldwide has more than doubled in three years, rising from 325 million in 2016 to 722 million in 2019. The number of devices is projected to reach more than </span></i><a style="color: #008000;" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/487291/global-connected-wearable-devices/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20connected%20wearable,than%20one%20billion%20by%202022." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 billion by 2022 end</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example of this is Google&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Google Nest. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product helps a user control their home&#8217;s temperature. All nest products (mobile app, smartwatch app, and thermostat) stick to a similar design pattern, distribute functionality according to the device&#8217;s specifics, and build a user interface relevant to the system&#8217;s elements. Similarly, the way a user interacts with the Nest is the same across all platforms.</span></p>

<h3><strong>5) Coding becomes a part of the Design Process</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14043" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Overview-1-1011x550-1.png" alt="Mobile app development" width="677" height="368" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Overview-1-1011x550-1.png 1011w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Overview-1-1011x550-1-300x163.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Overview-1-1011x550-1-768x418.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a question that always goes around on whether a designer should learn how to code and make it a part of the design process, as a designer can come up with feasible technical suggestions, but there&#8217;s a point in this context that a designer is a designer at the end of the day and mobile app development companies should ensure that the code should not take away the designer&#8217;s designing capabilities, which is the primary role of a designer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several prototyping tools, bridging the gap between designers and mobile app developers working on the design systems at a scale, helping programmers build upon designs instead of replicating them in production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward in 2022, you will see more design tools coming up, a popular example of such a tool is</span><a href="https://www.uxpin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UXPin</span></a><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">which lets you design, prototype, and collaborate all in one place.</span></p>
<h3>6) Designing for Speed</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14042 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mobile-Speed-App-Developer-Magazine_zwp3wqz6.jpg" alt="Mobile Apps Speed" width="631" height="522" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mobile-Speed-App-Developer-Magazine_zwp3wqz6.jpg 631w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mobile-Speed-App-Developer-Magazine_zwp3wqz6-300x248.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emergence of 5G has already created a stir in the world of technology. This new infrastructure will strengthen mobile connectivity, thereby improving the smartphone experience. Ten times faster than the existing wireless technology, as 5G gradually replaces 4G networks, users will notice a significant improvement in data transfer speed and latency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that any mobile services, be it an application or a website, optimize it for mobile to support the speed and full capabilities of 5G networks.</span></p>

<h2><strong>The State of UI/UX Design In Mobile App Development</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state of UX Design in mobile app development has not taken the traditional approach; rather then it has been adapting to changes not only in user interactions, preferences, and behaviors but in physical changes to the very devices you use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology changes, the design must also adapt to provide users with a varied range of options so that they can find the ones that best fit their needs. User experience encompasses all aspects of the end user&#8217;s interaction with a company, its services, and its products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping an eye ahead on the latest design trends will help UX designers and mobile app developers to innovate, collaborate all in one place and at pace.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Summing Up</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blog is all about UI/UX Design and </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/mobility/top-10-mobile-app-development-trends-and-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">trends in Mobile</a> App Development, and now it&#8217;s clear that if a mobile app UI/UX design is bad, then it will for sure not attract the users, and ultimately mobile apps will be less consumed by the users. So while building, the mobile application must focus on UI/UX design, advanced technologies, features, and functionalities.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the mobile app development process, all the development factors starting from <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/40-best-app-startup-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>app idea</strong></a> research to releasing the app on the app store or Google play store, play a vital role. If the developer skips any of the stages like testing and security configuration, it will affect the mobile app UI/UX design, functionalities, and user interface. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage such things before starting the development process, make the proper module as <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>ValueCoders</strong></a> (one of the </span>best <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-outsourcing-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing software development to India</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) developers made.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Do you want to create a mobile app, but are you not sure how to get it designed well to attract users?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, a great app experience is a magic ingredient for your app&#8217;s success. Not only does it entice users to visit your application multiple times, but it also makes Android app development hassle-free by defining concise design boundaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are striving to secure an application with a splendid look and feel, you can leverage various UX/UI design strategies that can make your app look hot and sour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will look over some UX/UI design methods for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/android-app-development-company-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">android app development</a> that can add crispness to your app design and can make it the biggest hit in the year 2020. </span></p>
<h2><b>UX/ UI Design &#8211; The Magic Ingredient </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telling the importance of eloquent user experience design is quite difficult. Though, we can simply understand that UX design strives to fulfill the users’ needs in accordance with the look and feel of the app.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, users’ complete journey on your application depends upon the user experience. This is a simple roadmap that allows you to define the entry and exit of a user on your application. A concise and well-constructed UX /UI design is the major factor for the success of various business applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, UX/UI design is all about how a person feels while interacting with your application. Is he finds it hard to use? Can he navigate through different features and options easily? Well! App design strategies usually consider these questions and aim for a positive impression.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2><b>How to create an incredible UX/UI design for your app? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several things to consider while designing your mobile app. Here are some points that can help to strategize your design practice. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span><b> # Emphasize On App Experience </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An app comprises value when people find it and use it. Thus, engaging the target audience is the most prominent goal, and this you can achieve by creating something that people want to experience. Thus, </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=richandroidapp_13287_rg121&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software outsourcing companies</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> always focus on the app experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern users are looking for more ease and interactivity in apps, thus the use of Augmented reality is gaining significant traction. Making an enjoyable and delightful user experience can boost user app credibility and can steal the eyes. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13309" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="340" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While user experience is all about the users’ perception and interaction with the application. UX design combines visuals, sounds, actions, touch, social stigma, and emotions to create an outstanding user experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is to “give users what they want and a bit additional”. With your application, offer your services effectively and efficiently, while compelling them to think, “Wow, this app is excellent”.</span></p>

<hr />
<h4><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are some points that you must be mindful of</span>: </strong></em></h4>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Never utilize inconsistent and wrong icons for basic functions like Edit, Delete, Share, Send, etc. The basic purpose of every icon must be defined and clear. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always determine the accuracy and quality of your UI on different devices having indifferent screen sizes. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never stuff the screen with too much content and icons. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always use good quality graphics. Most should have common sizes. </span></li>
</ol>

<hr />
<h3><b># Declutter </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major recommendation in almost every design guide is “declutter”. Decluttering makes your interface look easy and lite. Remember, clutter is the biggest enemy of your app design. Thus, overloading too much information on your app screen can ruin your app look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every icon, image, and button can make the app screen complicated, so choose wisely. Believe me; clutter looks worse on the mobile screen. So, be mindful of decluttering, and follow the given practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13306" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1.png" alt="" width="512" height="270" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /> </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never show too much information to users. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always keep content to a minimum. Focus on users&#8217; needs. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure to keep minimum interface elements. Design simple and make it extremely easy. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive disclosure techniques can be helpful for showing several options. </span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b># Use Modern Design Trends </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the arrival of many new technologies, UX/UI design trends also change. Leveraging design trends can help you stun the people. It will also help in attracting your target audience uniquely. </span></p>

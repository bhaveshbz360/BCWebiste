This seamless connectivity has also impacted the buying habits of consumers worldwide.

<h2><strong>Need for eCommerce Application Development </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When around <a href="https://whop.com/blog/ecommerce-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow noreferrer" data-wpel-link="exclude">80%</a> of consumers are using their smartphones to make purchases online, the importance of having an eCommerce app cannot be overlooked. Let’s look at the benefits of eCommerce apps that will help you make a better decision.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An eCommerce app benefits both small and new businesses and attracts customers easily</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials, one of the primary segments of online consumers, prefer buying on mobile devices</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce app helps in brand building and better customer service</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving a personalized and more responsive experience attracts more customers. They can shop on the go while traveling, having a meal, or while exercising without the need to carry heavy laptops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s move to the approach a business should take for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ecommerce app development</strong></a> But, before that we will learn the types of eCommerce apps.</span></p>

<h2><strong>eCommerce App Types</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*sgQ6WJ5RYvUeE21G" alt="steps for ecommerce development " width="904" height="314" data-image-id="0*sgQ6WJ5RYvUeE21G" data-width="1440" data-height="500" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.simform.com/blog/steps-for-ecommerce-mobile-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-href="https://www.simform.com/blog/steps-for-ecommerce-mobile-app-development/" data-wpel-link="external">Image source</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are mainly four categories of eCommerce apps:</span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Business-to-Business (B2B) eCommerce App</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications that enable businesses to exchange their goods or services via mobile channels are called B2B eCommerce apps. Alibaba is one of the most popular examples of this type of app, wherein retailers can directly connect with manufacturers to purchase a product.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Business-to-Consumer (B2C)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common and widely used application types is a B2C app, which enables a business to sell its product directly to the consumer without the need for a retailer. Amazon is a well-known example of this type of app.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of apps are meant for consumers to exchange their products or services with consumers. OLX is an example of a C2C eCommerce app, wherein buyers and sellers can connect without needing a middleman.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Consumer-to-Business (C2B)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some businesses act as buyers for products and services such as design, content, etc. Upwork and Github are some platforms that connect consumers or professionals with businesses.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Developmental Components of eCommerce App</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every business has different goals, and what components should be added depends on those parameters. However, some developmental components of eCommerce apps are common:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Multimedia Content</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An application will have images, videos, texts, graphics, etc to make the user journey seamless and engaging. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Servers</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to have powerful servers that can support large quantities of different types of content. The server should be reliable, robust, and secure at the same time.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Information Exchange</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information exchange in eCommerce apps mainly uses wireless, cable, and telecommunication services. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Device Access</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different users install apps on different devices. For example, some might access Netflix on television, while others will use it on a mobile, laptop, or tablet. Therefore, it is important to consider device access when developing the application.</span></p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">13. One-Page Checkout</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last feature that you should consider adding is a one-page checkout.

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Steps To Follow While Creating An Ecommerce App</strong></h2>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#1. Customer Needs Assessment</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step in ecommerce mobile app development is to identify your customers&#8217; needs. What are your customers looking for in an app? What features would make their shopping experience easier and more enjoyable? Consider these things mindfully as you design your wireframes and storyboards.</span></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">#<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2. Create a design for your app</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you know what your customers want, it’s time to start designing your app. This will involve creating wireframes and storyboards showing how the app looks and functions. Having a solid design before you start coding is important, as this will help ensure a smooth e-commerce application development process.</span></p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#3. Decide Programming Language Stack</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick a programming language that you want to use. Many languages can be used for mobile app development, such as Objective-C, Swift, for iOS apps, and Java for Android. If your business already has a large team of e-commerce developers who know one of these languages, it looks suitable to stick with it so they don’t have to learn anything new.</span></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#4. List of requirements &amp; start coding</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a good design and the language your team will use, it’s time to start coding. You’ll need an API (Application Programming Interface) and a backend so that your app can function and connect to your company’s databases. Make sure you don’t forget about legal issues such as copyright infringement! Your IP attorney should help you find all potential problems before it’s too late.</span></p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#5. Intensive Testing</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most successful apps are those with good reviews, customer feedback, and ratings. You can improve your app’s rating by constantly listening to customer feedback and implementing changes based on what they say. Once your ecommerce development company and you’re confident everything is working as it should be, release your ecommerce app.</span></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">#6. Continuous Upgradation For Ecommerce Development</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing an ecommerce app is never really done. There are always new features and updates to consider. Ensure you have a team to handle these tasks so your app remains up-to-date and compliant with all legal requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The steps above provide a general overview of the process of developing an e-commerce app. By following these steps, you can create a successful app that meets your customers&#8217; needs and helps your business grow.</span></p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Wrapping Up</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecommerce apps are the future. If your business is not developing an app for customers, it will soon be left behind in the dust. Keep in mind that building an ecommerce app is never really done.</span></p>

<h2><b>Shopify Cons</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there are many benefits of Shopify website, like everything, it also has its limitations or disadvantages. Let’s have a look at some of the cons of Shopify:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Monthly Fees</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify offers a monthly subscription fee, which can add up over time. There are different pricing plans available, but even the basic plan can be a significant expense for small businesses.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Transaction Fees</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to monthly fees, Shopify charges transaction fees if you use payment gateways other than Shopify Payments. This can increase your overall costs, especially if you have a high volume of sales.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Limited Customization</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Shopify provides many themes and customization options, there are limits to how much you can modify the design and functionality without advanced technical skills. For more complex customizations, you might need to hire a developer.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>App Costs</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the apps that enhance your Shopify store come with additional costs. Depending on the number of apps you need, these costs can add up quickly, increasing your overall expenses.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Platform Dependency</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Shopify, your store is dependent on the platform. If Shopify experiences downtime or technical issues, your store could be affected. Additionally, if you decide to switch to another platform, migrating your store can be challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By weighing these cons against the benefits of Shopify, you can hire Shopify programmers and take an informed decision about whether Shopify is the right for your business.</span></p>

<p><b>Browser Inconsistencies:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Web developers often encounter situations where the same HTML and CSS code renders differently across various browsers. For instance, a layout that appears perfect in Chrome might have unexpected spacing or alignment issues in Internet Explorer. This inconsistency can lead to frustrating user experiences and necessitates careful adjustments to ensure visual uniformity.</span></p>
<p><b>Varying Rendering Engines:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Browsers employ rendering engines, which are software components responsible for displaying web content. These engines can have distinct behaviors in interpreting and rendering web elements. For instance, a CSS rule might work smoothly in Firefox&#8217;s Gecko engine but cause unexpected results in Safari&#8217;s WebKit engine. Adapting designs to accommodate these differences is a critical aspect of compatibility.</span></p>
<p><b>Feature Support:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Browsers evolve by introducing new web technologies and features for </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/enterprise-software-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>enterprise software development services</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, not all browsers implement these features at the same pace. This can pose challenges when developers want to incorporate cutting-edge functionality while maintaining compatibility with older browser versions. Strategies such as progressive enhancement or graceful degradation help ensure graceful fallbacks for unsupported features.</span></p>
<p><b>Legacy Compatibility:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Legacy browsers, like Internet Explorer 11, still have a user base that requires consideration. These older browsers often lack support for modern web standards and may require workarounds or alternative solutions to achieve compatibility without sacrificing the user experience.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Integration: Promoting a Consistent User Experience" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LOexXELj4Ng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><b>Responsive Design:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Due to the proliferation of devices and screen sizes, responsive design is crucial for a consistent user experience. Achieving this involves designing layouts that fluidly adapt to different screen dimensions. However, this can be complex, requiring careful planning and testing to ensure content remains readable and usable across various devices.</span></p>

Designers must consider touch gestures, screen sizes, and device capabilities to ensure a seamless experience. Adapting a website&#8217;s interface to cater to these behaviors while maintaining a cohesive design can be challenging.</span></p>
<p><b>Performance Trade-offs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Compatibility measures can sometimes introduce additional code or scripts to address browser-specific issues. However, these additions can affect a website&#8217;s performance, leading to slower load times or reduced responsiveness. Balancing compatibility and performance optimization requires careful consideration.</span></p>
<p><b>Security Concerns:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Implementing compatibility strategies should never compromise a website&#8217;s or user data&#8217;s security. Integrating third-party libraries or plugins for compatibility should be done cautiously to prevent vulnerabilities.</span></p>
<p><b>Testing Complexities:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Comprehensive testing is crucial to identify compatibility issues. However, testing across different browsers, devices, and platforms is time-consuming and resource-intensive. It involves replicating user interactions and scenarios to uncover discrepancies that might affect the user experience.</span></p>
<p><b>User Experience Consistency:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Striving for consistency in user experience across various platforms and devices is a fundamental challenge. Users expect a unified journey while interacting with a brand, and maintaining this cohesion while accounting for platform differences is a meticulous task.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tackling these challenges demands technical expertise in cross-platform and </span>cross-browser compatibility<span style="font-weight: 400;">, creative problem-solving, and a deep understanding of user behavior. Addressing them effectively is key to delivering a flawless and immersive user experience in the digital landscape.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The web pioneer T<strong>im Berners-Lee</strong> once said</em>, <strong>“The web does not just connect machines; it connects people.” </strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This statement reflects the power of the internet and its ability to bring people closer.  </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the world becoming interconnected through the web, having an impactful online presence is important for businesses. It helps them and their target audience to connect better with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Forbes survey, there are 1.13 billion websites worldwide, but only a fraction are frequently used and updated. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be surprised that the number of businesses with a website grew to 71 percent in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your business doesn’t have an online presence, you will miss out on big opportunities. To help you get started, we list the most reputable web development firms in this blog post. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you want to hire developers or companies, these companies can help you with everything related to web development. </span></p>
<h2><strong>How We Have Shortlisted the Companies?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have identified the top 9 web development companies with a global presence, which is an important criterion in our shortlisting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the key factors that helped us in selecting the best web app development company: </span></p>
<p><b>Expertise </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We searched for companies with diverse skill sets, including front-end and back-end development, UX/UI design, mobile app development, and e-commerce solutions. Companies with expertise in advanced technologies like AI, blockchain, and AR/VR were given extra credit.</span></p>
<p><b>Proven Track Record</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We checked portfolios &amp; case studies to identify companies that have delivered successful projects across various industries. Additionally, client testimonials and feedback played an important role in understanding the real-world impact of their work.</span></p>
<p><b>Global Reach &amp; Clientele</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, we considered the companies’ global reach and clientele while finalizing companies offering back-end or front-end development services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top cloud companies with a global presence and a diverse client base were given priority because they could serve clients from different cultural backgrounds and regions.</span></p>
<p><b>Innovative Solutions</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We looked for companies that pushed boundaries by offering unique solutions and raising the bar in web development. A creative and forward-thinking approach showcased their potential to lead the industry.</span></p>
<p><b>User Experience (UX)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top cloud computing companies with a user-centric approach, focusing on seamless navigation, intuitive design, and exceptional user experiences, garnered special attention. Their UX audits and design thinking methodologies reflect their commitment to improving customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><b>Reliability &amp; Timely Delivery</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timeliness and adherence to project deadlines were significant factors in our assessment. We sought companies known for their reliability and the ability to deliver high-quality results within stipulated timeframes.</span></p>
<p><b>Industry Recognition &amp; Awards</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognition within the industry and awards demonstrate a company’s standing and peer appreciation. These also distinguish them as leaders in the web development arena.</span></p>
<p><b>Post-Launch Support &amp; Maintenance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, we considered top cloud providers offering comprehensive post-launch support and ongoing maintenance services as this depicts their commitment to long-term client partnerships. </span></p>
<p><b>Overall Reputation and Client Satisfaction</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we considered each company&#8217;s overall reputation in the market, evaluating their brand image and client satisfaction ratings. Companies with a strong positive reputation and a history of satisfied clients were at the forefront of our selection.</span></p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Finally, ensure that potential hires are comfortable working with your team and understand your company culture. It’s essential to hire someone who fits in well with your existing team and can hit the ground running from day one.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">By taking the time to screen resumes carefully, you’ll be able to find the best candidate for the job. Once you’ve identified your top choice, you can begin onboarding them and starting the project.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Conduct Telephonic Interviews</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you’re hiring software developers, it’s required to conduct phone interviews to get an understanding of a potential candidate’s technical skills.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">When meeting with potential developers, one important thing to consider is if they have experience working with offshore web development. Working with remote developers can save money and help bring your product to market faster.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, it requires trust and communication on both sides to ensure everyone is on the same page. Ask candidates about their experience working with remote teams and any challenges they’ve encountered.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In addition, you should also ask how they manage communication with other developers and their team lead. Communication is key in any software development project, and having a developer who can effectively communicate with their team can make all the difference in a successful product launch.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">When meeting with developers in person, it’s also required to evaluate their technical skills and competency.

<p class="graf graf--p">4. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Technical Expertise</strong>: Assessing the technical expertise of the developers you’re considering hiring is essential. Don’t just assume someone is qualified because they list the right skills on their resume — verify their experience by asking them questions about their past projects and providing coding tests.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">5. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cost</strong>: Last but not least, consider the cost of hiring software developers. Depending on the project’s complexity, expertise &amp; experience of the developer, the charges can vary greatly. You’ll want to balance quality and cost so that you don’t overspend or settle for subpar results.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">By taking the time to properly consider all of these factors before you begin your search, you can ensure that you find the right software developers for your project. Good luck!</p>

We combine business domain knowledge, proven methodologies, and the technical expertise of 450+ skilled software professionals to yield high-quality solutions that add value to businesses.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">We proudly announce that Vinove has been awarded another prestige certification — ISO 9001:2015 and CMMi Level 3 for its services and development. We are commanded by these governing bodies and will continue delivering best-in-class services.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">What Is ISO 9001:2015</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">ISO’s Quality Management Systems-Requirements (QMS) series of standards is a suite of certifications that cover vital topics such as quality management, supplier management, product realization, and service provision. ISO 9001:2015 provides businesses with requirements for designing, implementing, and maintaining a quality management system to ensure customer satisfaction by meeting customer needs regarding features and time requirements.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The specification requires processes to be continually evaluated, enhanced, or revised to meet the company’s changing business needs. In addition, it can help the company build and maintain a culture of continual improvement, leading to sustainable performance improvements for all products or services offered. The standard also includes provisions on records management, corrective action procedures, and configuration control.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">The Benefits of Implementing ISO 9001:2015</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">The benefits of implementing this standard are many, as they provide a way to measure the quality &amp; performance of your organization. If you’re looking for ways to improve your business, ISO 9001:2015 is a great place to start, as it offers -Improvement in quality &amp; efficiency -better customer satisfaction -improved safety, and environmental protection. It’s important to remember that not all businesses need ISO. However, when you decide to apply, there are many benefits:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">An ISO certification provides proof of competence at every level of your operation. With this assurance, employees can focus on doing what they do best.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Increases customer satisfaction by providing a system of guarantees on quality.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It helps improve all aspects of your business, from efficiency to communication.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Once you implement your quality management system, you’ll have a way to measure success.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It allows your business to work with other companies that have certified their organizations (making them easier partners).</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">About Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Capability Maturity Model Integration, or CMMI, is a framework for improving software development organizations’ processes and product quality. The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute developed CMMI. The model’s five maturity levels increase organizational capability and rigor. Here are the five maturity levels:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">1. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Initial</strong> — New businesses go through an unpredictable environment that leads to increased risks and inefficiency at this stage.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">2. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Managed</strong>&#8211; At this level, companies have formalized their software engineering practices with documented policies &amp; procedures.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">3. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Defined</strong> — These companies have documented plans for improvement at this stage.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">4. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Quantitatively Managed</strong> — Companies have measurement systems that quantify how well they’re meeting performance targets in the project management’s six dimensions (quality attributes) in process areas.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">5. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Optimizing</strong> — Companies must establish metrics and quantitative goals for each maturity level before progressing to the next one. You may outsource some aspects of your software development process at this stage if you don’t have the staff available internally.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The final stage occurs when an organization has achieved all other stages, has established its own metrics system from within, and can reliably assess its progress in improving productivity, efficiency and effectiveness over time through iterative activities.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Benefits of CMMI in Software Development</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a complete process improvement model for developing, maintaining, and acquiring software systems. It is built upon eight capability areas:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Planning, organizing, staffing, directing &amp; controlling the work</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Analysis &amp; design</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Implementation and testing</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Operation &amp; maintenance</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Evaluation of results</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Problem detection</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Diagnosis</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Correction</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">CMMI provides a structured set of processes that can be tailored to meet the specific needs of any organization. CMMI is an invaluable asset to any organization that seeks to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance performance.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One way to ensure the success of CMMI is by training employees on how it works so they can take ownership of its implementation. If you are looking for a trustworthy <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-software-developers-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software development company</a>,</strong> look no further than us!

<hr />
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">The Need For Integrating Systems</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">CMMI is a voluntary standard, which means organizations can choose to use it or not. But most large companies have adopted CMMI in some form. If you’re looking for work as a software engineer, your next employer will likely either be using CMMI or be interested in learning more about it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Overall, the benefits of ISO 9001:2015 are overwhelmingly positive. It will help your business grow by providing a formalized system for quality control and improvement. Implementing this international standard can not only improve your business’s processes, but it can also make you more competitive in your industry.

<p class="graf graf--p">A business-to-business (B2B) transaction is when a company purchases products and services from another company for its use instead of resale.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Small businesses often rely on larger companies to provide goods or services they cannot produce or deliver themselves. For example, a restaurant may not make all of its menu items but buy food from local producers and vendors.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros &amp; Cons of B2B</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">B2B eCommerce is a large part of the eCommerce industry. There are many benefits to using eCommerce websites for businesses, but there are also some drawbacks.

<p class="graf graf--p">This typically refers to a business that focuses on selling its products directly to end-users. For example, Amazon is B2C since it sells books and other items directly to consumers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Most notably, B2C sites have more complex user personas because they deal with people from all walks of life who might have wildly different needs and expectations from your site.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">As such, B2C sites usually require more product-specific information and customer support options (such as live chat) because many visitors will likely need help deciding what to buy or how to use your product effectively.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros &amp; Cons</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">B2C eCommerce allows businesses to sell products and services to consumers online. There are many benefits to <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/b2c-ecommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">B2C eCommerce</a>. However, there are also some drawbacks to B2C eCommerce, such as the potential for increased competition and the need for a strong marketing strategy.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros</strong></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Reach: eCommerce websites have the potential to reach a global audience 24/7. This benefits businesses that sell products or services that can be consumed online.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Cost: Setting up and running an eCommerce website is generally more cost-effective than setting up and running a brick-and-mortar store. You do not have to pay for physical space, inventory, or employees.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Convenience: eCommerce websites are convenient for both businesses and consumers. Customers can shop online at home, and businesses can operate their stores from anywhere in the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cons</strong></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Security: Security is one of the biggest concerns for businesses and consumers. When dealing with sensitive information like credit card numbers, it is essential to ensure that your website is secure.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Lack of Personal Connection: Another downside of eCommerce is that there is no personal connection between the business and the consumer. If you sell products requiring customer service or support, this can be an issue.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Competition: The eCommerce industry is highly competitive. To succeed, you will need to have a well-designed website and offer products or services that are unique and in demand.</li>

<p class="graf graf--p">There are two basic categories of online commerce websites: Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B). Here’s a breakdown of how they differ.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">-&gt; B2C sites focus on serving individual consumers, often through mass production and distribution of products. On the other hand, B2B sites are targeted at businesses that purchase products in bulk to resell them individually or use them as parts or components in final manufacturing.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">-&gt; Another significant difference is that B2C sites sell services while B2B sites sell physical goods.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">-&gt; The prices on a typical B2C site are usually set by the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-development-services?utm_source=hire_ecom_dev_com&amp;utm_medium=B2B+VS+B2C&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_25367" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">eCommerce app development company</a> offering the product for sale, whereas with a specific B2B site, price quotes from different vendors can be compared against each other.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">-&gt; With a business-to-consumer (B2C) model, businesses sell directly to consumers. In a business-to-business (B2B) model, on the other hand, companies sell products or services to other businesses as opposed to consumers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">-&gt; B2B website generally does not need an online store offering individual products. Instead, they can typically provide customized solutions through their site. A B2C website, on the other hand, needs to provide individualized items so customers can select exactly what they want from the site.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">-&gt; With a B2B website, you generally need employees with industry expertise to provide high-quality customer service. If you run a B2C website, however, you don’t necessarily need employees with deep knowledge about specific industries because you will be selling general products to everyone.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">-&gt; B2B sites generally cater more towards small businesses than large ones. They often have limited budgets and don’t have as much money to spend on marketing campaigns. On a B2C website, however, you might find more prominent brands advertising their products.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">B2B vs. B2C: A Comparison Based On Parameters</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Most people assume that both eCommerce sites look the same, as they share many similarities, such as product listings, shopping carts, and shipping methods.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, you need to know about the subtle differences between these two websites to optimize their performance and create a better user experience (UX).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Let’s take a look at the critical areas of difference between these two types of eCommerce sites.</strong></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Overall Purpose</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">B2C eCommerce sites are typically focused on generating sales, while B2B eCommerce sites are more concerned with facilitating transactions between businesses. This often results in different design approaches and different features being prioritized.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Target Audience</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">B2C eCommerce sites are generally designed to be accessed by individual consumers, while B2B eCommerce sites are meant to be used by employees of other businesses. This can affect the language used on the site and the payment methods offered.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sales Process</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">B2B transactions are often more complex than B2C, involving multiple decision-makers and a longer sales cycle. B2B eCommerce sites need to be designed to accommodate this process, with features like quote requests and account management.</p>
<div>A B2B eCommerce site, be it a <a href="https://virtocommerce.com/blog/best-b2b-ecommerce-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow noreferrer" data-wpel-link="exclude">B2B selling platform</a> or wholesale distribution platform, needs to be designed to accommodate this process, with features like quote requests and account management.</div>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Target Market</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you start building your website, one of your most significant decisions will be how to define your target market.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For B2B companies, choosing a niche is less critical than it is for B2C eCommerce companies. Some B2B sites serve multiple industries or markets within a single sector.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">That’s because their customers don’t buy products — they believe in solutions that solve problems and help them achieve their goals.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Instead of focusing on demographics and psychographics, often used in consumer marketing, many B2B companies use behavioral data to understand their customers’ needs and wants.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Website Structure</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The structure of a B2B website is entirely different from that of a B2C website. B2C sites use user experience design and pop-ups; their counterparts are designed to be purely transactional.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Without an individualized approach, selling online will always be harder in B2B than B2C. Once the customer has purchased something, the sale should not be considered complete.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There should always be more opportunities for engagement through social media or email marketing campaigns, ensuring that people who bought products get value out of them after purchasing them.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A successful B2B site also includes detailed product descriptions and interactive tools such as chatbots or contact forms, so customers can find what they need without the hassle. There are <a href="https://www.webceo.com/blog/seo-for-ecommerce-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">tips on SEO strategies for eCommerce websites</a> that can help to better  structure your page</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Information Architecture</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Most business owners may not even know that a website can have an architecture.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">But it does!</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">While both types of websites should be easy for users to navigate, some key differences between their structures have everything to do with audience and purpose.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is no wonder businesses choose B2B over B2C in many cases, but what makes one stand out from another? What makes one more successful than another?</p>

<hr />
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Here are some generalizations about each type of site</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1) Audience &amp; Purpose</strong> — A B2B site has different needs than a B2C site regarding purpose and design. For example, while the primary goal of a B2C site is to create revenue through selling products and services, the goal of a B2B site will be to build relationships with other companies or professionals.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2) Attention Spans</strong> — B2C sites can get away with asking for less input from users because shoppers usually aren’t shopping around too much before making purchases.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, in B2B situations, you’ll need to ask more questions up front to give your potential customers information they need about your product or service so they know whether or not they want to do business with you.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3) User Experience</strong> — Remember how audiences use their computers and devices when designing a website. If you are creating a B2C website, remember that people are looking for something specific, fast! They don’t have time to read long paragraphs or watch videos. They want what they came for.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In contrast, B2B websites should focus on providing detailed content that offers value to readers; otherwise, you risk losing them altogether by overwhelming them with too many options and choices.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Content Distribution Methods</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">You can reach many potential customers by using a combination of distribution methods. You must implement these strategies early in your launch, whether it’s pay-per-click ads, social media, search engine optimization (SEO), or email marketing campaigns.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Things You Need to Consider When Making Your Decision:</em></strong></p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">What are your company’s goals?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Is there room for growth?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">What is your customer base?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">What is your average order size?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Do you have a brick-and-mortar location nearby where people will come to purchase items from your store instead of ordering them online?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Are you looking to open up shop locations across the world?</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">If so, then <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">B2C</strong> may be right for you.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Is your primary customer base local or global?</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Do most of your orders typically contain small items or large ones?</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If most of your orders contain large items, consider<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> B2B</strong> because shipping costs could eat into profits with each order.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you’re looking to build a customer base internationally, then B2C might be best because it has a more significant international reach. It all depends on what kind of business you want to create and what type of customer you want to attract.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What is alike in both (B2B vs. B2C)? — Lead Generation Techniques</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Business to business (B2B) commerce may seem like a world apart from business to consumer (B2C) commerce, but one crucial thing remains consistent across both channels: LEADS.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Leads are what every company wants, and that includes online businesses. Whether you’re selling cars or canned vegetables, a website visitor can be your next customer — if you know how to capture their information and convert them into leads.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Capturing new customers can be difficult without an effective lead generation strategy. One of the best ways to generate leads is through social media campaigns, creating content people want to share with their networks and providing incentives for anyone who does so.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Here are three things to keep an eye on</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">1. The e-commerce market will continue to grow</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is good news for businesses that are already established in the e-commerce space, as well as those that are looking to enter the market. The growing e-commerce market presents a massive opportunity for businesses to reach new customers and sell more products.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">2. Mobile commerce will become more important</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Mobile commerce, or m-commerce, is already a big part of the e-commerce market. And it will only become more critical in the years to come. Customers are increasingly using their smartphones and tablets to shop online. EMarketer projects that m-commerce will account for nearly half of all e-commerce sales by 2021.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This trend is driven by the increasing number of people who own mobile devices and the improvements in mobile technology, such as faster internet speeds and better payment options.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">3. Social media will play a more prominent role in e-commerce</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Social media is already a big part of e-commerce, but it’s expected to have an even more significant impact in the years to come. More and more businesses are using social media to reach their customers and promote their products. And with the rise of social commerce, we’re seeing that consumers are increasingly using social media to make purchases.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Conclusion</strong></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">Headless Commerce is evolving. In the past, businesses would focus on driving traffic to their website and converting that traffic into sales.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, in today’s digital age, more and more businesses are moving towards a headless commerce model. This is where the customer experience is no longer constrained by the limitations of a traditional <strong>eCommerce website</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the State of Headless Commerce in 2024.</span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>We will look at the benefits of headless commerce, as well as some of the challenges.</strong></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">What is Headless Commerce?</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is an architecture where the frontend and backend decouple.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The backend (i.e., commerce platform or CMS) hosts the eCommerce data, while the frontend is typically a mobile app, Progressive Web App (PWA), or IoT device which uses APIs to pull that data when needed.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*VlW4Jh2yP0Ji7GvO" width="650" height="528" data-image-id="0*VlW4Jh2yP0Ji7GvO" data-width="686" data-height="557" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Techemizen</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Headless commerce differs from traditional e-commerce, where the frontend and backend tightly ally. And so, the eCommerce data is hosted by a single platform (Magento).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, as the frontend and backend are in the decoupled form in headless commerce, <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-ecommerce-developers?utm_source=Hire_eCom&amp;utm_medium=Web_Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Headless_eComm&amp;utm_id=NKY_23897" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">dedicated eCommerce developers</strong></a> can pull data from multiple systems (e.g., ERP system) through APIs to create a more seamless experience for customers.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">How Does Headless Commerce Work?</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When a customer interacts with a headless commerce frontend (e.g., mobile app, PWA, or IoT device), they are actually communicating with an API gateway. This is the layer that sits in between the customer and the backend system(s).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The API gateway then communicates with the various backend systems to get the data for the frontend to function.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, a customer searches for shoes on an eCommerce mobile app.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This search request is sent to the API gateway, which then communicates with various backend systems (e.g., commerce platform and product information management system) to retrieve this data before sending it back to the mobile app in real-time.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Why Use Headless Commerce?</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are many benefits of using a headless commerce model. Some of the key benefits include:</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Flexibility and Scalability</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">As headless commerce frontend and backend are in a decoupled condition, businesses can easily scale their eCommerce operation by scaling the number of API gateways.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This also provides more flexibility as businesses can easily change the front end without having to worry about the backend.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Improved Customer Experience</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Headless commerce is more flexible and offers a higher level of personalization, leading to an improved customer experience.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, if a business has multiple channels (e.g., mobile app, PWA, and IoT device), customers will have a seamless experience across all channels.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Leveraging Emerging Technologies</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">With the growth of IoT and voice search, businesses can leverage APIs to pull data from backend systems into these new frontends.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Without headless commerce, businesses would need to build dedicated mobile apps for each device (e.g., Apple Watch). This is not only expensive but also time-consuming.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Cost Savings</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Headless commerce can lead to cost savings for businesses as they can reuse the same backend systems for multiple frontends (e.g., mobile app, PWA, and IoT device). In addition, there are no licensing costs for using an API gateway.</p>

<hr />
<h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Remain Competitive</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Headless commerce can help businesses stay competitive as they can quickly launch new features and channels to market. Moreover, as headless commerce is more flexible, businesses can quickly adapt to changes in customer behavior.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Agile Marketing</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">With a traditional eCommerce platform, changing marketing campaigns (e.g., free shipping) can take weeks or even months to implement as it requires the dedicated support of IT developers and designers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In contrast, headless commerce enables marketers to quickly test new campaigns and make changes in real-time without waiting too long due to slow development cycles.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Simple Customization</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">A headless commerce platform is more customizable than a traditional platform. This is because the frontend &amp; backend are decoupled, so you can use any technology or tool to build your customer-facing interface.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In contrast, with a traditional eCommerce system, you will not get sufficient backend support or access.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Faster loading time</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">In headless commerce, the frontend will not get any error on changes to the backend. This means that you can minimize downtime as there are no delays when updating content or implementing new features in your eCommerce storefront.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This also leads to faster loading times for customers and a better overall user experience.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Better search engine optimization (SEO)</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">With headless commerce, the frontend is independent of the backend. This means that you can optimize your eCommerce storefront for search engines without having to worry about changes to the backend system.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, if you wanted to make a change in your mobile app (e.g., add more product descriptions), this wouldn’t affect the backend system.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Security and compliance</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Headless commerce provides a higher level of security as it is not affected by changes to the backend. For example, if a security vulnerability was discovered in the backend, this wouldn’t impact your frontend as they are decoupled.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This also means that headless commerce is compliant with industry regulations (e.g., PCI DSS).</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Headless Commerce in 2024<img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ly07ssKzw6BbK_Rw" width="870" height="348" data-image-id="0*ly07ssKzw6BbK_Rw" data-width="1000" data-height="400" /></h3>

<p class="graf graf--p">Headless commerce is quickly becoming a popular solution for businesses looking to create their own storefronts. The trend has been growing since 2018 and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It’s expected that by 2022, headless commerce will continue its growth and become more mainstream.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Headless commerce is expected to continue growing at a rapid pace in 2022 due to:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The rise of IoT devices (e.g., smart speakers, connected cars) requires an eCommerce storefront that works across multiple channels seamlessly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The rise of voice search technology such as Alexa or Google Assistant requires new interfaces that are optimized for voice search.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The emergence of social commerce as a viable channel to sell products and services online through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Rise of mobile apps (e.g., shopping apps such as Sephora Beauty Insider) or web-based sites (e.g., Amazon) that require a headless commerce platform to function correctly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Need for businesses to deliver personalized experiences over all channels (e.g., web, mobile, social) with the same backend systems and content management system.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Headless commerce enables them to do this without having separate frontends or interfaces for each channel type like traditional eCommerce platforms do today.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Differences Between Headless Commerce vs Traditional Commerce</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Headless commerce is different from traditional eCommerce in a number of ways.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">First, headless commerce is more flexible as businesses can easily change the frontend without having to worry about the backend. In comparison, traditional eCommerce platforms do not offer enough backend support.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Second, headless commerce enables businesses to leverage emerging technologies such as IoT and voice search. With a traditional eCommerce platform, businesses would need to build dedicated mobile apps for each device.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Third, headless commerce can lead to cost savings for businesses as they can reuse the same backend systems for multiple frontends. In contrast, with a traditional eCommerce system, you will get less backend access.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Fourth, headless commerce provides a higher level of security and compliance as it does not affect by changes to the backend, whereas traditional eCommerce platforms are vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Fifth and finally, headless commerce enables businesses to quickly test new campaigns and make changes in real-time without having to wait for long periods of time due to slow development cycles. In contrast, with traditional eCommerce platforms, this can take weeks or even months.</p>

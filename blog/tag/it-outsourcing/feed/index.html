<h3><strong>Problem: Lack of trust in the quality of work</strong></h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges when outsourcing to India is a lack of trust in the quality of work. This can be a valid concern, as outsourcing often means handing over critical tasks to an external team with whom you have limited control or visibility. However, this does not mean outsourcing to India is inherently risky or unreliable.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose reputable </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-outsourcing-services-company?utm_source=30773+-+why-business-do-not-outsource-to-india&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software outsourcing services</a> with a proven track record of delivering high-quality work. Look for vendors with industry certifications, positive customer reviews, and a strong reputation in the market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Establish clear communication channels and set quality control measures that align with your business objectives. This could include regular progress reports, periodic quality assessments, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure performance.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Build a culture of trust and accountability. This means being transparent about your expectations, providing constructive feedback, and celebrating successes.</li>
<li>Invest and <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/dedicated-development-teams?utm_source=30773+-+why-business-do-not-outsource-to-india&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire dedicated software development teams</a> that provide training and upskilling opportunities that align with your business needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At ValueCoders, we understand the importance of quality and trust. That&#8217;s why we have robust quality control processes, including </span>regular audits, performance metrics, and feedback loops. We also heavily invest in our team&#8217;s training and development to ensure they have the skills and expertise to deliver high-quality work. With years of experience in software development and a team of over 450 talented developers, we have the expertise and resources to help businesses overcome their outsourcing challenges and achieve their goals.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the most recent technologies to provide our clients cutting-edge solutions, including AI, machine learning, blockchain, and others.

<h3><strong>Problem: Communication barriers</strong></h3>
<p>Another common outsourcing issue that businesses face is communication barriers. With teams often working in different time zones and speaking different languages, miscommunication and misunderstandings may occur, leading to errors, delays, and project failure.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish clear communication channels and protocols, including expectations for response times, communication frequency, and preferred communication method.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use technology to facilitate communication, such as video conferencing, chat, and screen-sharing tools like Zoom, Slack, or Microsoft Teams.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish a common communication language to ensure all team members can communicate effectively.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build cultural awareness and sensitivity into your communication protocols to overcome cultural differences.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At ValueCoders, we recognize the critical role that communication plays in </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services?utm_source=30773+-+why-business-do-not-outsource-to-india&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">IT outsourcing services</a>. That&#8217;s why we have a dedicated team of project managers and communication specialists who work closely with our clients to establish clear communication channels and protocols. We use the most recent communication tools and technologies, such as Slack and Zoom, to facilitate real-time collaboration and ensure all team members are on the same page.</p>

<hr />
<h3><strong>Problem: Time-zone differences</strong></h3>
<p>Another significant challenge businesses may face with Indian outsourcing companies is the time zone difference. With India being several hours ahead or behind many other countries, it can be challenging to schedule meetings and ensure that all team members work together effectively. Time zone differences can lead to delays in communication, missed deadlines, and project delays.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish precise schedules and timelines that take into account the time zone difference.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner with </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-consulting?utm_source=30773+-+why-business-do-not-outsource-to-india&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software consulting services</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">companies that use collaboration tools and technologies like Trello, Asana, and JIRA to manage projects and keep track of progress across different time zones.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule check-ins and status updates regularly to ensure all team members are up-to-date and working together effectively.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner with a company with developers working in shifts, such as ValueCoders, to ensure you can connect anytime.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At ValueCoders, we understand the importance of time zone differences in outsourcing. That&#8217;s why we have multiple locations worldwide, allowing us to provide 24/7 support and ensure that projects stay on track, regardless of the time zone. We use collaboration tools and technologies like </span>Asana, JIRA, and Trello to manage projects and keep track of progress across different time zones. Our project managers and their teams work closely with clients to establish precise schedules and timelines, ensuring that projects are delivered on time and within budget.</p>

<h3><strong>Problem: Cultural differences</strong></h3>
<p>Another outsourcing to India problem that businesses may face is cultural differences. India has a diverse culture, with a different approach to communication, work, and problem-solving than many Western countries. These differences can create misunderstandings, lead to miscommunication, and affect the project&#8217;s overall success.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educate the outsourcing team about the client&#8217;s culture and working style.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish clear communication channels and protocols to avoid misunderstandings.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage regular feedback and check-ins to address any cultural differences that arise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use collaboration tools and technologies like video conferencing, instant messaging, and screen sharing to facilitate communication and understanding.</span></li>
<li>Consider outsourcing <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-services-company?utm_source=30773+-+why-business-do-not-outsource-to-india&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">offshore software development services</a> to a partner with experience working with clients from different cultural backgrounds, like ValueCoders.</li>

<p>At ValueCoders, we recognize the importance of cultural sensitivity in outsourcing. Our team of experts has experience working with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds, allowing us to understand their unique needs and working styles. We use collaboration tools and technologies like instant messaging, video conferencing, and screen sharing to facilitate communication and understanding between our team and clients.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome cultural differences, we regularly give feedback and check-ins, ensuring that the project continues and that our clients are happy with the results.

At ValueCoders, we&#8217;re committed to delivering top-notch software solutions that meet our clients&#8217; unique business needs, regardless of their cultural backgrounds.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Problem: Security concerns</strong></h3>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of shared information, companies may have security issues while outsourcing to India. Concerns about intellectual property theft, data breaches, and other cybersecurity risks could harm the business.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement strict security protocols and measures to protect sensitive information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure all employees and contractors sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and undergo a comprehensive background check before accessing sensitive information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employ encrypted email, VPNs, and safe file-sharing services as secure communication and collaboration tools.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To identify and stop security breaches, you should routinely monitor and audit the outsourced team&#8217;s access to critical data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider outsourcing to a partner with a strong security and compliance track record, such as ValueCoders.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By outsourcing to </span>offshore consultants in India <span style="font-weight: 400;">like ValueCoders, who have a strong security and compliance track record, businesses can rest assured that their sensitive information is safe.

<h3><strong>Problem: Legal issues</strong></h3>
<p>When outsourcing to India, businesses may face legal issues such as violation of intellectual property rights, breach of contract, and non-compliance with local laws and regulations. These legal issues can lead to costly litigation and damage the business&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent ambiguity or misunderstanding, make sure that legal professionals thoroughly design and evaluate all contracts and agreements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure the outsourcing partner complies with all relevant rules and regulations by performing extensive due diligence on them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add in the contract language that addresses legal concerns and details the remedies that may be used in the event of a violation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use technology and tools for project management to enable real-time project progress tracking and ensure deadlines are fulfilled, lowering the likelihood of disagreements and legal concerns.</span></li>
<li>Work with reputable Indian outsourcing companies with a strong track record of legal compliance, such as ValueCoders.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Benefits of Outsourcing to India</strong><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-30781 aligncenter" title="Benefits of Outsourcing to India" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Benefits-of-Outsourcing-to-India.jpg" alt="Benefits of Outsourcing to India" width="684" height="513" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Benefits-of-Outsourcing-to-India.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Benefits-of-Outsourcing-to-India-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Benefits-of-Outsourcing-to-India-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses aiming to simplify processes, save costs, and boost efficiency can profit significantly from outsourcing to India. Some of the main advantages are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cost savings:</b> <b>Indian outsourcing companies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can significantly reduce labor costs, as labor is much cheaper in India compared to other countries. According to a study by </span><a href="https://community.nasscom.in/communities/productstartups/why-businesses-hire-indian-companies-software-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASSCOM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, outsourcing to India can save businesses up to 80% in operational costs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Access to a large talent pool:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Engineers, software developers, and data scientists are just a few of India&#8217;s highly qualified and educated professionals. Businesses now have access to various skills and knowledge they would not otherwise have.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Faster time-to-market:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Using the knowledge and resources of their outsourcing partner, companies may shorten the time to market. Businesses can keep ahead of the competition and react rapidly to shifting market needs with shorter development cycles.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Flexibility:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Businesses can expand or contract their operations as needed. Businesses that want to enter new markets or those whose workloads fluctuate will find this helpful.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With software development outsourcing, you don’t have to pay for the extra staff, equipment, and software that would typically be necessary to complete a project in-house. Furthermore, you can outsource the project to a provider specializing in the software development you need, ensuring the best outcome at a lower cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By outsourcing the project, you can also benefit from economies of scale, as you can benefit from the provider’s existing infrastructure, tools, and processes. Therefore, if you are looking for a cost-effective way to develop software, outsourcing makes the best resource.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, software development outsourcing is also a great way to access a larger talent pool due to its cost-effectiveness. By hiring an outsourcing company, you don’t have to pay for training and other related costs that come with hiring a permanent employee. This helps you save money while still getting access to the best possible talent. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we will discuss the key challenges you might face when considering <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services?utm_source=Organic+-+29124-reasons-for-software-outsourcing&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">IT Outsourcing Services</a>, why they arise, and how to mitigate them. From managing expectations to communication issues and more, read on to learn more about the pitfalls you may encounter when outsourcing.</span></p>
<h3>Lack of Control</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When outsourcing, the loss of control can be an alarming reality for those not accustomed to working with third-party contractors. In these cases, it&#8217;s challenging to maintain a positive outlook should something go awry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though ultimately, you must ensure the project reaches completion, regardless of your ability to monitor it directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce these risks, entering into a clear and specific contract is advisable before commencing any project. This agreement should outline the various roles and responsibilities for all involved and define the desired expectations for each party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, by researching and carefully selecting an experienced software development outsourcing provider, you can guarantee the project&#8217;s success and ensure that the best decision is made for your business.</span></p>
<h3>Management Issues</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT outsourcing can be challenging because you rely on another company to handle a critical part of your business. Some ways to mitigate this risk include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Do your research: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your research should include proper references, reliable reviews, and get a sense of the track record of potential outsourcing partners.</span></li>
<li><b> Be clear about expectations: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you contact a software outsourcing company, you need to be clear about your expectations. </span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are you looking for, and by when? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What quality standards should be met? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate all of this upfront to avoid misunderstandings later on.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><b> Have a contingency plan:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If things go wrong, you must have a contingency plan. </span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will you do if the outsourced work is not up to par? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will you handle delays? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a plan will help you react quickly and effectively in the event of any problems.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3>Issues with Communication</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might face a few key communication issues when outsourcing your blog content creation.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Language barrier</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If you&#8217;re outsourcing to a country where English is not the first language, there may be communication issues. Keep your instructions clear and concise, you can also use a tool like Google Translate to help with language barriers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Time zone difference</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If you outsource to someone in a different time zone, coordinating schedules and communicating in real time becomes difficult. You should share your expectations upfront; you can also use tools like Skype or email to stay in touch.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cultural differences</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: What might be considered acceptable or professional in one culture might not be in another. Maintain clear and concise communication to avoid any misunderstandings.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>Maintaining Quality</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few key challenges you might face when outsourcing your work. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Quality Control</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When you’re not overseeing the work yourself, ensuring that the quality standards can be challenging. Therefore, handpicking a vendor with a proven track record of delivering high-quality work is essential.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Managing Expectations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When you outsource, you’re essentially handing over control of a project to someone else. Setting clear expectations is essential to avoid unpleasant surprises.</span></li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re not working side-by-side with your team, keeping everyone on the same page can be challenging. Effective communication is critical to ensure everyone is on track and meeting deadlines.</span></li>

<h3><b>Cost-Effective Solutions</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is sometimes difficult to maintain the cost-effectiveness of the options. The challenges that come across are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Type of Work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Outsourcing some types of work is costlier than others. For example, complex engineering tasks or jobs requiring specialist skills may be more expensive to outsource than relatively simple manufacturing tasks.</span></li>
<li><b>Supplier Location</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Wages and other costs can vary significantly between different countries, so it is essential to consider this when sourcing suppliers. For example, suppliers in developing countries may offer lower rates than those in developed countries.</span></li>
<li><b>Size and Scale of the Project</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The cost of outsourcing can increase with the project&#8217;s size and scale due to improved coordination costs and communication costs.</span></li>
<li><b>Level of Service Required:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The necessary level of service from the supplier will also impact costs. For example, if you need a high level of customer support or wrapper services, this will generally cost more than if you only require essential supplier services.</span></li>

<h3><strong>All Tasks Cannot Be Outsourced</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some specific tasks cannot be outsourced. These tasks require a high level of personal interaction or customization, time-sensitive tasks, and a high degree of knowledge about your company and products.</span></p>
<p><b>Some examples of tasks that cannot be outsourced include:</b></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Sales: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling is a highly personal process requiring a deep understanding of your product and customer. It&#8217;s also a process heavily reliant on relationships &#8211; something difficult to replicate when outsourcing.</span></li>
<li><b> Customization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you have products or services that need to be customized for each customer, it will be tough to outsource this process. This customization requires close interaction with the customer to understand their specific needs.</span></li>
<li><b> Time-Sensitive Tasks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some tasks simply cannot be rushed. For example, if you&#8217;re launching a new product, you must ensure all the details are perfect before it goes live. Running this process could result in serious mistakes being made.</span></li>
<li><b> Highly Knowledge-Intensive Tasks:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some tasks require in-depth knowledge of your company and products to complete correctly. For example, if you&#8217;re writing marketing copy, you need to understand what makes your product unique and how to position it in the market. This task is difficult to outsource because it requires intimate knowledge of your business.</span></li>

<h2><strong>IT Staff Augmentation</strong></h2>
<p>IT Staff Augmentation is a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=Organic+-+ValueCoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software Outsourcing Service</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that offers businesses a flexible, cost-effective alternative to hiring in-house IT personnel. This service is typically used when companies require additional IT resources for special projects or to supplement the existing IT team during peak periods.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies also benefit from shorter ramp-up times since the experts are already familiar with the project scope and can hit the ground running. </span></p>

<p><strong>Benefits of IT Staff Augmentation</strong></p>
<h3>Cost-Saving:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT staff augmentation is a cost-effective way to gain access to specialized skills and expertise without hiring, training, and managing the personnel yourself. By leveraging existing resources, you can reduce your overhead costs and the cost of hiring and onboarding new personnel.</span></p>
<h3>Flexibility:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With IT staff augmentation, you can choose precisely who and how many people you need for a project or task. This allows you to scale up or down quickly as needed, making it easier to meet changing project requirements.</span></p>
<h3>Access to Experts:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With IT staff augmentation, you can easily access the best and brightest in the industry, regardless of location. This allows you to work with the most experienced and knowledgeable professionals who can bring their skills and expertise to your organization.</span></p>
<h3>Improved Efficiency:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By utilizing an IT staff augmentation approach, you can improve your overall efficiency by reducing the time and money spent on training and managing new personnel. As a result, you can focus more of your time and resources on delivering quality results faster.</span></p>
<h3>Reduced Risks:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT staff augmentation reduces the risk of hiring personnel that may not meet your needs or can perform up to expectations. With an IT staff augmentation provider, you can vet each individual before hiring them, ensuring they have the right skills and knowledge for the job.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Drawbacks of IT Staff Augmentation</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the many advantages of IT Staff Augmentation<span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are a few drawbacks.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, since you don&#8217;t have direct control over the IT staff, there is no guarantee that they will meet your standards</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of direct supervision could lead to delays in project delivery due to miscommunication and misunderstandings</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compliance issues may arise if you use a foreign IT staff augmentation company</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When Should Companies Choose For IT Staff Augmentation?</strong></span></h2>
<p>IT Staff Augmentation <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a great way to supplement the existing IT team with specialized skills and expertise. This type of service allows companies to add a small group of experienced IT professionals on a short-term basis to help complete complex tasks that would otherwise require more internal resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When deciding whether to choose IT staff augmentation, it is essential to consider the following factors:</span></p>
<h3>Timeframe:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a project requires a short-term solution, or the timeline is too tight to find and onboard the right staff internally, then IT staff augmentation may be the best option.</span></p>
<h3>Cost:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the scope of the project and the expertise needed, hiring additional IT staff could be more cost-effective than outsourcing the entire project or hiring a dedicated team of experts.</span></p>
<h3>Complexity:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a project requires specialized knowledge or skill sets, it might be better to utilize IT staff augmentation than to teach current employees or find and hire new full-time staff members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, it is essential to evaluate the individual needs of each project to determine the best course of action for a company&#8217;s IT needs.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Outsourcing</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing is when companies assign specific tasks or services to an external provider, usually at a cheaper cost. Companies use outsourcing for various reasons, including cost savings, access to new technologies, focus on core competencies, and access to talent outside their workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is often used for labor-intensive tasks, requires specialized expertise, or takes too much time for the internal staff to manage. Outsourcing can be an excellent way for businesses to maximize their resources and increase efficiency without sacrificing quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to IT outsourcing statistics by </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/it-services/it-outsourcing/worldwide#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Segment%20IT,US%24144.80bn%20in%202022)." target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the ​revenue in IT outsourcing is projected to show a yearly growth rate (CAGR) of 8.93% from 2021. It will result in a market volume of US$551,956.3M by 2026.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Benefits Of Outsourcing</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to choosing the proper method for staffing IT needs, outsourcing is a popular option. By <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing IT services</a>, businesses can reap various benefits, including:</span></p>
<h3>Cost Saving:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most significant advantages of outsourcing is that companies don&#8217;t need to pay different salaries and overhead costs associated with recruiting and managing an in-house team. As multiple clients share the resources used by the outsourcing vendor, companies have access to quality resources at competitive prices.</span></p>
<h3>Quality Work:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourced projects are handled by experienced professionals with the relevant expertise to work on complex projects. This eliminates any risks related to novice handling of tasks or inadequate knowledge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, since most vendors are ISO certified or follow other international standards, customers can rest assured about the quality of work delivered.</span></p>
<h3>Scalability:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies no longer need to worry about having insufficient resources or technical capabilities when there&#8217;s an urgent requirement or quick project turnaround times. They need to contact the vendor who will be able to deploy additional resources as per their requirement. This scalability allows companies to take up new opportunities without worrying about resource constraints.</span></p>
<h3><b>Focus On Core Business Activities:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing frees the company to focus more on core business activities instead of non-core activities like recruitment, training, etc., as these can be easily outsourced. This allows them to use their time and resources better and gain more efficiency in their operations.</span></p>
<h3>24/7 Service:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most providers offer 24/7 support for critical systems. This ensures that problems are addressed promptly, even outside regular working hours.</span></p>
<h3>Expertise:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of expertise, the quality of service by external service providers is usually higher than internal teams.</span></p>
<h3>Risk Reduction:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since external service providers handle routine maintenance tasks, they help reduce system downtime caused due to failure or breakdowns. This helps reduce financial losses due to system outages and internal issues.</span></p>
<h3>Professionalism:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional outsourcing firms typically provide standardized procedures, processes, and workflows, leading to higher customer satisfaction. All these factors make outsourcing an attractive option for companies looking for efficient staff augmentation solutions.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Drawbacks of Outsourcing</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to outsourcing, some drawbacks need to be considered. Let&#8217;s look at them:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, finding a reliable outsourcing partner with the skills and experience required to handle the job efficiently can take time and effort</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the differences in language and culture, communication can be challenging</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing can lead to unexpected costs and delays if not appropriately managed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, businesses relinquish control over specific processes when outsourcing, which could lead to potential security and privacy issues</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>When should Companies Outsource?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies should outsource when they need a quick and cost-effective solution. They need the resources or the capacity to hire, train, and manage the staff necessary for a particular project or task. This is especially true for non-critical operations that can be controlled externally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit of outsourcing is that you only pay for the services you need and can scale quickly if your needs change. Furthermore, outsourcing gives you access to specialized expertise without investing in training or resources you may not need.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Outsourcing vs Staff Augmentation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant difference between outsourcing and IT staff augmentation is the degree of control and responsibility each provides. On the other hand, by leveraging these services, organizations can supplement their existing IT teams with experienced professionals specializing in specific technologies or processes needed for their projects. </span></p>

<h2><strong>Dedicated Team</strong></h2>

They are an ideal choice for companies with complex technical needs or are building new systems.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a dedicated team, the organization benefits from access to professionals with the specialized skills and expertise needed to get the job done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, dedicated teams help organizations save on recruiting costs since they are usually hired as a package deal and don&#8217;t require additional recruitment and onboarding costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, these teams offer organizations a cost-effective way to build their IT infrastructure without investing in other resources.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of Dedicated Teams</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dedicated team is ideal for companies looking to scale up their IT operations without investing in extra resources. When a company opts for a dedicated team, it hires a group of developers and other IT professionals focused solely on the assigned tasks. Below are the benefits of a dedicated team.</span></p>
<h3>Cost-Saving:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations can save money with a dedicated team since they don’t have to pay extra infrastructure costs or recruitment fees.</span></p>
<h3>Flexibility:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dedicated team provides flexibility because teams can be adjusted according to business requirements. Teams can be scaled up or down as needed to meet specific demands. </span></p>
<h3>Quality Control:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies can ensure that their dedicated team delivers quality results by carefully managing workflow processes. </span></p>
<h3>Easy Access:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies can easily access and communicate with the dedicated teams as required.</span></p>
<h3>Scalability:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies can quickly scale up or down their teams depending on business requirements, so they have control over the size and capacity of their teams‌. </span></p>
<h3>Long-term Relationship:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies can build long-term relationships with their dedicated teams since they work together over an extended period.</span></p>

<h2>Drawbacks of Dedicated Teams</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a dedicated team of IT professionals is a great way to ensure that your business is up-to-date and running optimally, but it also comes with some drawbacks.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One major downside of a dedicated team is the cost of setting up such an arrangement. As you are responsible for providing office space, computer equipment, </span>software outsourcing services<span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other necessary tools for the dedicated staff, the overhead costs becomes relatively high.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the dedicated staff has been trained, there needs to be more flexibility in changing their role or skillset. This means if the technology changes or new systems are implemented, one must retrain the entire team, which can be expensive.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the right people for a dedicated team can take time and effort, as the right combination of knowledge and experience may be available locally.</span></li>

<h2><strong>When Should Companies Hire Dedicated Teams?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies should hire dedicated teams when they need highly specialized skills, experience, and expertise to complete a project. Dedicated teams are best used when a business requires long-term support or the completion of an ongoing project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, if a company needs an app to be built or an enterprise software system developed, it would require the expertise and knowledge of a dedicated team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, businesses that don’t have an in-house IT department or lack the necessary resources to develop an IT infrastructure can benefit from hiring a dedicated team. These teams offer flexibility and scalability, enabling companies to adjust the size of their team based on their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dedicated team of IT professionals will be able to create customized solutions for a business’s specific requirements.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As organizations struggle to keep up with technological innovations and adapt to new practices, it’s not surprising that IT staffing needs are constantly changing. Keeping up-to-date on new technologies and finding professionals with the right skills to work at your company can be daunting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are many ways in which you can meet your staffing needs while ensuring those workers stay satisfied and engaged in their roles. One of the most effective methods is </span>IT Staff Augmentation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This e-guide will walk you through everything you need to know about Staff Augmentation Services, from what they are and how they work to choosing the best one for your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before exploring or ready to make a decision, just go through some awesome stats on IT staff augmentation services:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a study by Deloitte, the global IT staff augmentation services market is expected to reach $88.9 billion by 2022. The study also found that the North American market for these services is growing at a rate of 5.6% per year.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>IT Staff Augmentation: A Brief</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff Augmentation supplements an organization&#8217;s existing IT staff with additional personnel. We can do this in many ways, including hiring new employees, contracting with outside firms, or using temporary workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many reasons an organization might choose to augment its IT staff. One common reason is to boost workforce capacity to meet the increased demand for </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=Valuecoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software Outsourcing Services</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another reason might be to fill a skills gap within the existing staff. For example, if an organization is implementing a new software system, it may need to supplement its staff with personnel with expertise in that particular software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the reason, IT staff augmentation can be a helpful way to meet an organization&#8217;s needs. It can provide flexibility and allow an organization to respond quickly to changes in demand. It can also help reduce costs by allowing an organization to use highly skilled workers on a part-time or project basis rather than hiring them full-time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In staff augmentation, a company hires and takes advantage of employees’ talent from an outside staffing firm that provides services to meet your company’s needs.  </span></p>

<h2><strong>Types Of Staff Augmentation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many IT staff augmentations are available, we can categorize them into three types. Here’s a quick rundown of each category:</span></p>
<h3><b>Commodity:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are staff augmentation tasks that freelance contractors can easily and quickly handle. A quick search for a freelancer will turn up dozens of qualified candidates within minutes. There is no interview process to find the perfect person for the job. If you have one-time projects and need someone on your team to complete them, commodity staff augmentation is perfect.</span></p>
<h3><b>Non-commodity:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-commodity IT staff augmentation tasks are more in-depth and require skills or knowledge that are hard to find. If you’re looking for a specialized skill set, such as someone who knows how to design websites, you’ll probably have to conduct an extensive search, even if it means hiring someone full-time.</span></p>
<h3><b>Skill-based: </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skill-based staffing is used when a business needs to fill an open position with a skill set it doesn’t currently have on its payroll. There are often high barriers to entry for these positions because these skills are hard to find, so staffing agencies may require potential employees to take tests or prove their qualifications before being considered.</span></p>
<h3><b>Highly Skilled: </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-skilled staff augmentation falls into short-term and long-term categories. Short-term is what it sounds like, workers who come in for short periods (often weeks) while your regular team takes a vacation. Long-term hires typically stay on your payroll full-time, but you cannot handle 100% of their workload. They work as support while your regular team handles the heavier stuff.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Different Types of Staff Augmentation Models </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff Augmentation models can increase productivity and efficiency while providing access to skilled professionals who can help a company achieve its goals. Companies can improve their bottom line with the right model while successfully managing projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff Augmentation Models are divided into four main categories: Dedicated Team, Time and Materials, Project-Based Outsourcing, and Managed Services.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Dedicated Team Model</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is the most commonly used Staff Augmentation Model. This model involves hiring a team of dedicated professionals to provide specialized skills and expertise to a company. This team is then managed as part of the internal team, with all resources and expertise provided by dedicated professionals.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Time and Materials Model </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It involves engaging an external service provider hourly to supplement a company’s in-house staff. The service provider typically provides the necessary infrastructure and professional services to accomplish the project.</span></p>
<h3><b>The Project-Based Outsourcing model </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It involves having a service provider manage and execute the entire scope of a project from start to finish. This typically includes designing, developing, testing, and deploying the project. The service provider manages all aspects of the project life cycle and can provide specialized resources as needed.</span></p>
<h3><b>Managed Services</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a Staff Augmentation model where the service provider provides managed services such as hosting, maintenance, and support to a company. This arrangement allows companies to focus on their core business activities without worrying about managing and executing IT projects themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter which type of Staff Augmentation Model is used, it is important to ensure that the chosen service provider is reliable and provides quality service. It is also essential to have a well-defined agreement in place that outlines the terms and conditions of the partnership, as well as any other key details.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right model in place, companies can reap the benefits of staff augmentation without sacrificing quality or efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, one should select a suitable Staff Augmentation model based on the needs of the company and its budget. By selecting a reliable service provider, combined with a well-defined agreement, companies can ensure that they can maximize resources and achieve their goals.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Why Should You Hire An External Support Team?</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rely on an external support team for your IT needs when you need a more consistent and personalized level of service. When staff augmentation is in place, your company will be more productive because it’s free from responsibilities that take up valuable time and energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Augmentation Services come in many flavors, but their commitment to the customer is their common denominator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can hire either onsite or remote employees. Both have advantages and disadvantages, depending on your business needs.</span></p>
<h3><b>Onsite Staff Augmentation </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onsite staff augmentation means working with IT support professionals in your company’s office space. It gives them a direct line of sight into what’s happening with your network and your technology infrastructure to address the issues quickly and immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onsite staff augmentation is more expensive, but it gives you direct access to your support professionals. You can also choose when and how you would like their assistance.</span></p>
<h3><b>Remote Staff Augmentation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote staff augmentation means they work from another location outside of your office space, usually at home or in a co-working facility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With remote staff augmentation, </span>software outsourcing services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> are cheaper overall because there is no cost associated with office space or equipment that a contractor must use. However, these workers often require more oversight because they aren’t sitting in front of your company’s network daily.</span></p>

<h2><strong>How Do IT Staff Augmentation Services work?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of ways that IT staff augmentation services work. Typically, these services provide IT professionals to organizations on a contract basis. This can be done in a number of ways, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing IT professionals to fill specific roles within an organization on a short-term or long-term basis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing IT support on an as-needed basis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering managed IT services to supplement an organization&#8217;s existing IT staff</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT staff augmentation services can be customized to meet an organization&#8217;s specific needs. For example, an organization may need help with a specific project or application. In this case, the staff augmentation provider would supply the necessary personnel to get the job done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, an organization may need ongoing support for its IT infrastructure. In this case, the staff augmentation provider would offer managed IT services to supplement the organization&#8217;s existing staff.</span></p>

<h2><strong>When To Opt For IT Staff Augmentation Services?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are certain situations when opting for IT staff augmentation services makes sense. If your in-house team is already stretched thin and you&#8217;re facing an upcoming project with a tight deadline, augmenting your staff with outside help can be a lifesaver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another reason to consider staff augmentation is if you need expertise that isn&#8217;t available in-house. For example, if you&#8217;re planning a major website redesign, you may need to bring in a user experience (UX) expert or someone with specific design skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, staff augmentation can be a cost-effective way to maintain a high level of quality control. If you&#8217;re working on a critical project, augmenting your staff with additional quality assurance (QA) resources can help reduce the risk of errors and ensure a successful outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When deciding whether to augment your staff, it&#8217;s important to consider the cost and timeline of the project, as well as the skills and experience of your in-house team. You may contact a reputable IT staffing firm for advice if you&#8217;re unsure whether staff augmentation is right for your project.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilizing staff augmentation services can also help businesses save money.

<h2>What If Your Company Already Has A Strong In-house Technology Department?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company already has a strong in-house technology department, there is still good reason to hire an outsourcing provider. IT Staff Augmentation covers the unique skill sets required for specific projects or tasks. Still, it can’t be supported by an in-house IT team due to technical or logistical limitations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When staffing increases during peak periods, you may need temporary staff to augment the existing team. Outsourcing providers allow your organization to utilize this increased availability with little overhead.</span></p>
<p>IT staff augmentation companies<span style="font-weight: 400;"> can provide you with highly skilled &amp; experienced resources who know how to work with your systems and processes. Additionally, they can be contracted to bring on temporary staff when a significant workload increases. This gives you an agile technology team uniquely qualified to tackle projects of all sizes and scopes and allows you to concentrate on running your </span>staff augmentation development company<b>.</b></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Which Business Functions Will You Outsource?</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When outsourcing IT functions, it is important to start with the tasks that will have the least impact on your current staff’s workload. But what if you need help from outside companies to understand which IT services are best for your company? Consider asking for a free consultation from ValueCoders Consultants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determine which IT Staff Augmentation solutions will have minimal impact on your current staffing. Look at projects that don’t need to complete immediately or tasks that can be delayed. Your outsourcing provider should have no trouble helping you identify and prioritize which applications you should handle internally vs. which ones you should outsource.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinction is easier when your company only has a few IT personnel, and there aren’t any pressing needs for new software or hardware. For example, outsourcing services make sense if your business doesn’t need video conferencing equipment until your needs change and expand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is to make sure you always have an outside contractor to fall back on. This allows you to keep things under control in your business and take advantage of outsourcing when it makes sense for your company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you need help installing a new database management system, you can contact an IT Staff Augmentation provider for assistance. Afterward, go back to handling database management internally by leveraging a remote cloud database server from <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/cloud-services/amazon-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to research your options carefully and find an IT staff augmentation provider that you feel confident in. Each outsourcing agreement is unique, but all of them should offer a contract where you have complete control over when your company is on call for support and what happens when that time comes. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Staff Augmentation helps companies reduce operational costs and enhance core competencies. Companies must outsource their IT requirements to reduce operating costs and enhance core competencies. They must thoroughly understand how it works and choose the right service provider before outsourcing any part of their business operations to save operational costs.</span></p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">In-House Teams</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">In-house teams are often more efficient and can help your business maintain a strong sense of culture. However, in-house teams are typically less flexible and take longer to start.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">On top of that, you’ll need to spend time training employees before they become productive team members. If you hire an in-house team, it’s important to ensure everyone on your team has a defined role and is working towards a common goal.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Advantages Of Hiring In-House Teams</h2>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1CdJcbpSrnPGBJ6WtqA9Jg.jpeg" alt="Benefits of In-House Teams" width="800" height="504" data-image-id="1*1CdJcbpSrnPGBJ6WtqA9Jg.jpeg" data-width="800" data-height="504" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">The advantages of hiring an in-house team are numerous; some of them are described below. Moreover, seeing the advantages, you can easily decide to <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-software-developers-india?utm_source=hire_soft_dev&amp;utm_medium=web_blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_3047" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Hire Software Developers</a> for your company.</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Full Control</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">With an in-house team, you have full control over what they do and how they do it. You can set rules and standards and confirm that your employees are doing their job according to them.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This way, you don’t have to worry about whether or not they will be able to complete a project on time or if they will meet your expectations.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">With an in-house team, you can also choose who works with you and who doesn’t. If one of your employees isn’t performing well or isn’t a good fit for your company culture, then you can let them go without worrying about whether or not someone else will be able to pick up where they left off.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Better Quality</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you hire an in-house team, you can be sure they will provide a better quality of work than if you hired someone from an outsourcing company. The employees at an outsourcing company are usually independent contractors who work on several projects at once.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It means they may not always be able to give your project their full attention or may even lose interest in it altogether before they finish it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">With an in-house team, your employees will be dedicated to working on only one project at a time and will be more motivated to do a good job because they’ll know that their performance will directly affect how much you’re willing to pay them.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So, in this case, the Offshore Outsourcing vs. Hiring In-House Teams battle winner is In-House Teams.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Work Immediately</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you hire an in-house team, they will be able to start working on your project immediately. It means you won’t have to wait weeks or months before seeing any results. You can also work with them more closely and give them feedback as they’re working on your project so that they can adjust their approach accordingly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you hire an outsourcing company, it may take several weeks or even months before you get started because of all of the paperwork involved in hiring a new employee.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>In-Depth Understanding</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you hire an in-house team, they will better understand your business and what you’re trying to accomplish with it. This means that they will be able to provide more detailed feedback on your project and will be able to suggest ways to improve it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you hire an outsourcing company, however, their only concern will be completing your project as quickly as possible so they can move on to other clients.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">They won’t necessarily care about whether or not it’s a good fit for your business or if there are many ways that they can improve it. Many people think hiring an in-house team is better than hiring an outsourcing company because of all these advantages.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Disadvantages of Hiring In-House Teams</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">The disadvantages of hiring an in-house team are also many, some of which are given below.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Great Expenses</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Hiring an in-house team can be very expensive. You will have to pay them a high salary, which will cut your profits. There are also other expenses, such as office space and equipment. When you hire an in-house team, you need to assure that they have all of their equipment and that it’s up to date.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If not, you may need to purchase new equipment so that they can do their jobs effectively. It’s also important to consider whether or not you can provide them with a private office space where they can work without distraction from others.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Absence Issues</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you hire an in-house team, you need to consider that they will likely have a lot of absences. You need to be sure that their lack won’t impact your business.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You may want to hire a temp or another freelancer to fill in for them when they are absent. It’s also important to remember that many people who work from home often work from home because they don’t like working with others.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Time</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you hire an in-house team, you need to consider that getting them up to speed will take time. You may have to train them and show them how to do their jobs. It can be difficult for new employees who don’t know your business well enough to do their jobs effectively.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You also need to consider that it will take time for you and your employees to work together to be on the same page. If you cannot spend a lot of time with your employees, they may not be able to perform their best or even at all.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Offshore Outsourcing</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Offshore outsourcing has been a hot topic of conversation over recent years, and it’s not hard to see why. While some people are concerned about sending jobs overseas, there are many benefits to working with an offshore team that you can’t get when you hire in-house.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Working with a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/how-to-build-a-remote-team-for-ecommerce-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">remote team</a> saves you money on office space and overhead costs while allowing your business to grow quickly without sacrificing quality. And as a business owner, it’s important to remember that not all work can be done by employees who work out of your physical location.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you want to keep growing your business but don’t have room in your budget for more full-time staff members, offshore outsourcing might be right for you, so, at this point in <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/outsourcing-vs-hiring-in-house-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Offshore Outsourcing vs. Hiring In-House Teams</a> battle, Offshore Outsourcing is a clear winner.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Advantages Of Offshore Outsourcing</h2>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pupPRW_eJ961AKxg" alt="Benefits of Offshoring" width="800" height="600" data-image-id="0*pupPRW_eJ961AKxg" data-width="800" data-height="600" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">If I talk about offshore outsourcing advantages, there are plenty. Knowing these in detail, you can decide whether it is suitable for your business and decide whether to connect with <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/setting-up-a-dedicated-offshore-development-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Dedicated Offshore Development Center</a> or not.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Access to Experts</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">With an offshore outsourcing company, you can hire experts from all over the world. By hiring an expert from another country, you’ll have access to a much larger talent pool than if you were only hiring locally.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The best part about it is that since they are so far away, they are often willing to work at a lower rate than someone in your area. It means you can get better quality work at a lower price.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Economic Efficiency</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Another advantage of outsourcing your work to an offshore company is that you can save money. Since they are located in a different country, their labor costs will be much lower than if you were to hire someone locally.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, if you’re trying to find a web designer in your area, they will likely charge at least $50 per hour for their services.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you outsource your work to an offshore company, you can gain a competitive advantage over your competitors. It is because they can offer lower prices than you would be able to offer if you were hiring locally. By offering lower prices, they will get more customers and, in turn, make more money.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, even though they make more money, their labor costs will still be much lower than yours. It means they’ll have a higher profit margin than you and therefore be able to undercut your prices and steal away some of your customers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It’s essential to remember that while outsourcing can give you a competitive advantage over your competitors, it can also put them at an advantage over you.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Faster Turnaround Time</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you outsource your work to an offshore company, you’ll be able to get your work done much faster than if you were to do it in-house. This is because they have a larger workforce and more resources.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, if you need something done within a week, there’s a good chance that they can finish it in less time. However, if you <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire developers</a> locally, there’s a good chance that it would take a longer time to complete a project.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Disadvantages Of Offshore Outsourcing</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Here are some of the main disadvantages of offshore outsourcing:</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Time Zone Differences</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you hire an offshore team, there will be a time difference between your location and theirs. It can cause problems with communication, as well as make it difficult to manage tasks.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, if you have a task that needs to be completed at 8 AM your time, but they’re located in India, and it’s 2 AM their time, then you’ll need to wait several hours before you can discuss or review anything. It can lead to delays in productivity and ultimately a loss of revenue for your business.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Communication and Language Issues</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Because you’re working with a team that doesn’t speak your language, it can be difficult to communicate effectively. It can cause miscommunication and delays in productivity. It can also make managing tasks more difficult.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, if you want something done by a certain time, but they don’t understand what by a certain time means, then there could be delays in getting things done on time.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This will affect your business in terms of revenue or productivity. And because you aren’t communicating face to face with them, it may be challenging to read their body language or understand their tone of voice over email or phone calls.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Geopolitical Unrest</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you’re outsourcing to a country experiencing political unrest, then there could be problems with your business. For example, if you outsource to China and there’s a major political upheaval, your team may be unable to work or get paid. It can lead to delays in productivity and revenue loss.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-services-company?utm_source=off_soft_dev_sev&amp;utm_medium=web_blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_3047" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Offshore software development companies</a> are also vulnerable to natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis. If one occurs in their area, they won’t be able to work or get paid. It can lead to delays in productivity and revenue loss.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Offshore Outsourcing vs. Hiring In-House Teams</h2>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*p86G07N48XRm36gVfxEuEQ.jpeg" alt="Offshoring vs In-House Team" width="800" height="2268" data-image-id="1*p86G07N48XRm36gVfxEuEQ.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="3403" /></figure>
<h2>Things To Consider Before Choosing Offshoring Outsourcing and In-House Teams</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Now that we’ve looked at the offshore outsourcing vs. hiring in-house teams comparison table, here are some parameters you should compare while deciding on choosing between the two Offshore Outsourcing vs. Hiring In-House:</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h4">1. Quality Work</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Offshore outsourcing firms usually deliver high-quality work. This is because they have a team of experts in their field. They also have the latest tools and resources to complete the work quickly and efficiently. So if you want to get your work done quickly, hire a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software Outsourced Product Development Company</a>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">On the other hand, in-house teams may not be as efficient or knowledgeable as offshore outsourcing firms. This is because they’re not working in their area of expertise. And they may not have the latest tools and resources.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h4">2. Cost-Effective</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Offshore outsourcing is usually more cost-effective than hiring an in-house team. This is because you don’t have to pay for overhead costs or benefits. You also don’t have to worry about training them or managing them.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In-house teams can be costly because you have to pay for their overhead costs, benefits, and training. You also have to manage them, which can be time-consuming.</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="graf graf--h4">3. Flexibility</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Offshore outsourcing firms are usually more flexible than in-house teams. This is because they can scale up or down quickly, depending on your needs. They can also work around your schedule.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In-house teams may not be as flexible because they’re limited to the number of people you have on staff. And they may not be able to work around your schedule.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h4">4. Industry Knowledge</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Offshore outsourcing firms usually have a lot of industry knowledge. This is because they have a team of experts familiar with your industry. They also keep up with the latest trends so they can offer you the best possible solution.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In-house teams may not have as much industry knowledge because they’re not working in their area of expertise. And they may not be familiar with the latest trends.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h4">5. Cultural and Social Differences</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">There can be cultural and social differences when offshore outsourcing. It is because the team you’re working with is in a different country. They may have different values and beliefs than you do. It can lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is not an issue when you hire an in-house team because they’re in the same country as you are. You share the same values and beliefs. It can help to avoid miscommunication and misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So, these are some things you should consider when deciding between offshore outsourcing vs. hiring in-house teams.</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Making a final decision for Offshore Outsourcing vs. Hiring In-House Teams entirely depends on the specific needs of your business. <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services?utm_source=out_pro_dev_ser&amp;utm_medium=web_blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_3047" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Outsource Software Product Development Company </a>may be the best option if you need a high-quality, cost-effective, and flexible solution. But if you need a team with cultural understanding, then hiring an in-house team may be the better choice.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, in my opinion, you should pick the offshore outsourcing option as it comes with a plethora of benefits that an in-house team can’t provide. It is an excellent option to save on costs and get the job done quickly and efficiently.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Let’s move further and view the 10+ benefits of IT outsourcing in small businesses.  </span></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Know Why Small Enterprises Should Consider IT Outsourcing?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a small business and currently managing your IT infrastructure without any outside help, it might be time to consider outsourcing. There are numerous benefits that come from hiring experienced abroad and</span> <b>Indian outsourcing companies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for various needs. Here is why:  </span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Access Expertise</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a small business, you may not have the skills or resources to use all the latest technologies. By outsourcing your IT function to experienced and <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-it-outsourcing-companies-find-the-best-option-for-your-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Top IT outsourcing companies</a></strong>, you can get the best expertise and access to equipment without having to shell out large sums of money for in-house staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, you will also be able to avoid large capital outlays that can often put small businesses on shaky financial ground.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Avoid Capital Outlay </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses often don’t have the capital to invest in expensive equipment and technology. By outsourcing your IT, you will avoid having to make these huge investments that can risk an already shaky financial situation- meaning more stability for your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, IT outsourcing is an affordable solution that you will be able to keep up with your budget and provide the best technology solutions possible without having to hire in-house staff or invest heavily into expensive equipment. With IT Outsourcing, small businesses are provided with the best solutions without the high cost.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3><strong>3. Flexible &amp; Scalable </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most difficult parts for small businesses when they expand is that it can create a lot of &#8220;growing pains,&#8221; as well. Sure, new consumers are coming out to buy your products and services more often- but in many cases, this growth has caused some companies to struggle with keeping up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there&#8217;s an easy fix! Utilize outsourced IT support services, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about these problems any longer (and save even MORE money). And on the other hand: If things slow down during off-seasons? You&#8217;re able to easily scale back without losing anything, either.</span></p>

<h3><strong>4. Higher Productivity</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-21827 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Productivity-Inc.png" alt="top it outsourcing companies, Indian outsourcing companies" width="526" height="291" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Productivity-Inc.png 526w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Productivity-Inc-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image Source: BigStock</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you outsource IT services, your employees will be able to focus on their daily tasks and responsibilities without having to worry about the latest equipment or technology updates. You’ll also have access to experts that can help with any technical issues- so there won&#8217;t need to be time spent waiting around for IT support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT outsourcing helps businesses improve productivity by improving their employees&#8217; efficiency as well as increasing the speed at which they are able to get work done. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>5. Less IT Risk &amp; Costs of Technology Disasters </strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">IT outsourcing services</a></strong> can reduce the risk and costs of technology disasters by making it easier to find solutions when they arise. This is especially true for small businesses that don&#8217;t have any incentive or resources in-house to troubleshoot technical problems, such as power outages or server crashes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, </span>outsourcing companies<span style="font-weight: 400;"> will also help lower your company&#8217;s risk of security breaches, as they will be able to take advantage of a much more secure infrastructure. </span></p>
<h3><strong>6. Variety of Services Offered</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another great benefit is that when hiring an outsourcing partner, they can provide a variety of services- from software development or maintenance to cybersecurity. You won&#8217;t need the in-house staff to do everything all at once and can focus on what is most important to your business.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>7. Offer Around The Clock Service</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-21828 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed-10.jpg" alt="Outsourcing companies, IT outsourcing companies, " width="512" height="313" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed-10.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unnamed-10-300x183.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Image Source: ACHR News</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing IT services also gives your company around-the-clock service. You will no longer have to worry about taking time off in order to address technical issues or work on a new project, as the professionals you hire can do this for you.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, most outsourcing companies offer 24-hour support lines and live chat so that you never feel like you are alone.

<h3><strong>10. Increase brand loyalty</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing empowers you to get profoundly trained IT staff backed by management with years of experience. It&#8217;s difficult for most small businesses to create such an amazing team internally; it would be expensive and take too much effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, outsourcing allows you access to experienced managers that can make sure that you always have someone available who knows what your key focus is. A dedicated specialist will work long hours if necessary, so you never feel neglected &#8211; even when dealing with difficulties at home or on vacation. Ultimately, helping you by offering leading services so that you can increase your brand loyalty.  </span></p>

You can safely let experts handle what&#8217;s happening in today’s digital world while avoiding such mistakes that may be too complicated for a small business owner or manager to navigate on their own.  </span></p>
<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduced risk means more peace of mind when it comes to disasters like data breaches or ransomware attacks that not only destroy small businesses&#8217; productivity but also cost time and money. However, all this can be secured with</span> IT outsourcing services.<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting in touch with top IT outsourcing companies can help you avoid the capital outlay of technology and hardware. You&#8217;ll also have flexibility in staffing needs, so if your business takes off, you won&#8217;t need to worry about hiring a full-time IT specialist.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, most tech startups, in fact, enterprises have drifted away from developing new software products in-house. But is it right to stop growth in the face of a disaster such as this?</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the novel coronavirus is as big as a problem as it gets. But the world will eventually come out of it. At that time, would you want your startup to take its time to freshen up and understand the needs of the market? Or would you want to start preparing a great software product so you&#8217;re ready when the market needs it most?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure your choice would be the latter, but most businesses have their hands tied. They&#8217;re unable to operate due to lockdowns, disruption in supply chains, unavailability of staff, and out of myriad problems created by COVID-19. Yet, there are few businesses that are fortunately <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/covid-19-are-we-ready-to-face-this-global-adversity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">working as smooth as ever</a>, especially in the software outsourcing sector.</p>
<p>So if a business (maybe yours) is unable to work on an in-house software project due to COVID-19, is it a wise choice to outsource it to an <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">offshore software development company</a>? Why outsourcing is important? What are the benefits of outsourcing a software development project?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, if you&#8217;re a tech startup in desperate need to capitalize on an opportunity and establish a market presence, then:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1- This isn&#8217;t the best time to run your business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2- Once we&#8217;re done with COVID-19, the state of the market at the time will present unprecedented opportunities that startups could capitalize on. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the same time, your startup could be competing with 100s of established enterprises looking to capitalize on the same opportunities.</span></p>
<p>Is there something you could to have an edge over potential competitors in such a scenario?<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong> Product Development Outsourcing</strong></a> could be the masterstroke for a competitive advantage in the long-run. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-3822 size-full aligncenter" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg" alt="outsourcing product development" width="800" height="628" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development-300x236.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you may know, there are multiple options available in the market to build functional software products. However, when it comes to startups, there&#8217;s a conventional line of thought which says that the benefits of outsourcing are for enterprises only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you can certainly outsource product development as a startup and this is important to your business as well, especially in this pandemic situation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Benefits of Outsourcing</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple benefits of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing IT and software development services</a>. let&#8217;s start with cost.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cost-cutting</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing a budget is a big challenge for startups. However, outsourcing helps a lot to do it right. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In fact, according to a research, 87% of US companies outsource product development to save cost.  </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing provides a global talent pool at a low cost. You hire a backend developer (in-house) at  98000 USD/year and it comes down to 22000 USD/year when you outsource.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The risk is lesser</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of new products whose market is yet to be tested, outsourcing plays an important role in mitigating the risks of trying out something new. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Since the outsourced teams work on flexible models the risks are definitely lower.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>It&#8217;s Faster</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing the development helps in faster development with the Agile model and helps in tremendously reducing the time to market. </span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Technical Expertise</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may be new to the market. That&#8217;s not an issue until you have technical expertise with you. If you already have that, then it&#8217;s good, however, if you don&#8217;t- then it is better to outsource.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Free up time and more focus</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For startups, investing time into high priority things is very important. One of the greatest benefits of outsourcing is that you free up your time for other important things. This helps a lot.  This image will show you some other reasons why is outsourcing important:<br />

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>key steps for your startup to effectively outsource product development</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b><b>Choose the Right Vendor</b></b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right vendor for outsourcing application development is a must. An <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=blog_al&amp;utm_medium=startup_prodev_3816&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing company with expertise</a></strong> in the required development skills will surely be helpful. Picking up freelancers is definitely not advisable, as they cannot be relied upon, for taking up product ownership. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the important points to consider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while selecting a vendor for outsourcing development is the flexibility of hiring models. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps the startup choose a hiring plan that will optimize the costs of outsourcing in accordance with the development requirements. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important to evaluate the portfolio of the hiring vendor to understand the level of specialization in different business verticals.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Defining The Scope Of The Project</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second most important step in outsourcing your product development is to define the scope of the project. First, you need to convert the business idea into a business plan and then put down what all you need from a successful product. Defining the technology with which you wish to develop your product is another crucial decision. This also helps in defining the skill levels of the teams you wish to hire. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the scope of the project is defined and the vendor for product development has been chosen, the service level agreement with the vendor can be created. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps in ensuring that the outsourced teams are working according to the plan of action. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outsourced teams must be clearly communicated about the expectations and the milestones. This helps in developing mutually beneficial relationships with the outsourcing partner.</span></p>

<h3><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Communication</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping in touch with the outsourcing partner on a regular basis and reviewing project work in progress on a constant basis is important. This is helpful in improving project productivity levels. Motivating remote teams with incentives and appreciation is helpful in getting better business results.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overall, a continuous communication helps you to finish tasks smoothly.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 million businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are given birth every year? You will be shocked to know that approximately 50% of small</span><a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> businesses fail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the first five years of their business. This clearly shows a loophole in the business process.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we will be soon dealing with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will probably see more businesses dying. The economic impacts of the novel coronavirus will create a graveyard of failed startups, small-scale businesses, and even a few large-scale enterprises. How will your business prevent itself from making a place in this graveyard?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here the need to optimize the business process arises. The prime weapon applied to achieve such optimization is IT services. This has given a major boost to the IT outsourcing sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to research by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technavio</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><b><i>rising need to optimize business processes will be the key driver for the IT outsourcing market</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #1: Increase in automation outsourcing </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation has made human lifestyle highly convenient. In contemporary times, automation is embraced in all major arenas from enterprises to homes. Technologies like Artificial intelligence and robotic process automation are in great demand these days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market for artificial intelligence is predicted to reach </span><a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-market-74851580.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US$ 190.61 billion by 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #2: Need for more specialization</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are those days when the software was created just to take your business online or to make it compatible with the latest industry happenings. Today, </span><b><i>businesses are getting dependent on their applications for core processes</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this, they require <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Custom Software Solutions</a></strong> according to their individual demands. The skills of developers have become an important factor in choosing an IT outsourcing company. It is assumed that in future the requirement for polished skills will increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses have forgotten to compromise with quality. The need for personalization of services and products have motivated developers at varied locations to improve their skills, communication and innovation power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tabular representation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the skill rating of developers in different outsourcing destinations. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12509" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018.png" alt="Top IT Outsourcing countries" width="865" height="793" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018.png 865w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-300x275.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-768x704.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-600x550.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><br />

<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #3: Cloud sourcing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprises are transforming digitally which has resulted in greater public cloud adoption. By 2020, 83% of workloads of enterprises will be on the cloud according to the finding of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">LogicMonitor’s Cloud Vision 2020: The Future of the Cloud Study</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their findings, it was concluded that </span><b><i>AI and ML will be the greatest catalyst in increasing cloud computing adoption by 2020</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  This will require IT outsourcing service providers to develop more online data centers and equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With cloud computing, the security issue will increase. 66% of IT professionals think that security will be the primary concern while adopting cloud computing. Ultimately, expert knowledge of professionals working in IT outsourcing companies will be considered to save businesses from the loss caused by possible data breaches. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12511" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-6-min.png" alt="Importance of AI and ML" width="700" height="366" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-6-min.png 700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-6-min-300x157.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-6-min-600x314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #4: Increase in AR/VR service needs </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/615899/global-virtual-and-augmented-reality-headset-sales-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR/VR headsets sales</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach worth US dollars 9.7 billion by 2020. The not-so-old technology has allured customers of all sizes. Businesses in all industry domains, from healthcare to e-commerce are incorporating these technologies to add another reality to their products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">73% of mobile AR users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are satisfied or highly satisfied with their experiences. This paves a safe and healthy future for these technologies. In future businesses are going to invest in AR and VR projects incredibly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These technologies have boosted online shopping experiences, social networking sites, entertainment apps. There was still a lot of potential to be explored. Small businesses are turning up these technologies to offer something unique to their customers. </span></p>

<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #5: Introduction to new business models</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12512" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-7-min.png" alt="IT Outsourcing business models" width="700" height="366" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-7-min.png 700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-7-min-300x157.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-7-min-600x314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideas have become the essence of software industries. If you have an idea of getting a custom app developed, it will solve half of your problem. This is why in future businesses will shift to business models that will safeguard their idea. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New business models in the IT outsourcing industry will be </span><b><i>based on outcomes rather than outputs</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Do you know the difference between the two? The output is the result of the organization’s activities and the outcome is the level of success achieved by these activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will increase the pressure to deliver impeccable results to the software developers. The future models will also be witnessing contracts wherein the risk and responsibility will be shared among businesses and the IT outsourcing partner. </span></p>
<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #6: Less attention on cost</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I have written that business models will be more focussed on quality rather than the mere completion of work. Along with this shift, the focus from cost has also shifted. Businesses will no longer run behind the lowest cost quotation by software developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we cannot deny that a true businessperson will always focus on cutting their expenditures. But the value delivered has taken the place of primary concern. An ideal <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">IT outsourcing company</a> will be the one with skilled labors and outstanding outcomes at the least cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the </span><a href="https://agileengine.com/top-outsourcing-destinations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost of developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and QA in different popular IT outsourcing destinations. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12513" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-1-min.png" alt="Cost of developers in Top IT Outsourcing countries" width="869" height="500" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-1-min.png 869w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-1-min-300x173.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-1-min-768x442.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-1-min-600x345.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with this, you can match the skill ratings of the </span><a href="https://www.pixelcrayons.com/hire-app-developers?utm_source=vcsg&amp;utm_medium=vcsg&amp;utm_campaign=vcsg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="exclude"><span style="font-weight: 400;">app developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in different locations. The quality-price match can be an ideal choice for any business developer. For example, India is a destination with low-cost developers and placed at a considerably good rank among different destinations. Such combinations are in high-preference for developers. </span></p>
<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #7: Demand for cybersecurity and compliance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the industry of information technology, security becomes a primary area of concern. Since its inception, this industry has been facing threats and thefts. When top-notch companies like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook witness such security issues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it brings fears into the SMEs and startups as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has raised awareness among businesses which has turned into a demand. Companies demand that high-end security measures should be taken while developing an application for their business.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12515" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-8-min.png" alt="Cyber attack preperation" width="700" height="366" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-8-min.png 700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-8-min-300x157.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DO-YOU-KNOW_-8-min-600x314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my friends started a startup for an e-commerce store. He was not well-informed about the security checklist that should have been followed by his </span><a href="https://www.pixelcrayons.com/hire-web-developers?utm_source=vcsg&amp;utm_medium=vcsg&amp;utm_campaign=vcsg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="exclude"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hired web developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Once he got his web app developed, he faced issues in the payment gateway. The sensitive data like card details of customers who were logged into his e-commerce site started getting leaked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very small experience that I have witnessed very closely. A business can face a lot of such issues when it comes to security. This is why </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/01/07/83-of-enterprise-workloads-will-be-in-the-cloud-by-2020/#edeb1786261a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">66% of IT professionals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think that security will be the primary concern while adopting cloud computing. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12516" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-2-min.png" alt="Cyber Security" width="737" height="383" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-2-min.png 737w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-2-min-300x156.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pasted-image-0-2-min-600x312.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data encryption still has a long way to go. Cybercriminals have not and still not leaving any stone unturned in attacking the sensitive data.  IoT devices are at the most vulnerable position when it comes to cyber-attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a report by </span><a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/press/releases/spiceworks-study-reveals-wifi-attacks-challenge-it-professionals-keep-data-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spiceworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only 36% of IT professionals are confident in their ability to respond to cyber-attacks. This is quite scary! If the IT professionals are unsure then who are we relying on the safety of our data onto! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undoubtedly, in the future, the demand for optimum security from IT outsourcing companies will be on a rising spree.  In order to survive in the competition, it will become a necessity for IT outsourcing companies to provide highly secure applications. </span></p>
<h3><b>IT outsourcing Trends #8: Rise of New outsourcing destinations</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major destinations for IT outsourcing are located in Eastern Europe, South America and Asia pacific. These are the top destinations mentioned in the table below.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12517" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-2-min.png" alt="Top IT Outsourcing Destinations" width="871" height="319" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-2-min.png 871w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-2-min-300x110.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-2-min-768x281.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AgileEngine-_-Top-software-outsourcing-destinations-of-2018-2-min-600x220.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These locations have the largest share of global outsourcing revenue. Today India and China are the leading destinations among these fourteen locations.

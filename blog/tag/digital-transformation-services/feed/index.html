<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python may not be as fast as other languages, especially when doing tasks that need a lot of computer power. Even though Python is easy to use and makes things quickly, organizations might have trouble when they need their programs to run very fast.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Concurrency and Parallelism</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python&#8217;s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can slow down its ability to do many things at once, especially in programs that use lots of threads. This might make programs run slower when they&#8217;re supposed to run at the same time. Even though there are ways to fix this, it can still be hard to make Python work well with lots of things happening at once.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Scalability Issues</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python might have problems handling really big projects or websites with lots of visitors.

<h3><b>1. Adopt Agile Development Methodologies:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use flexible ways of working like Scrum or Kanban to help teams work well together, be ready to change, and improve quickly. Divide big projects into smaller jobs that are easier to handle, focus on the most important things first, and check regularly if the work is going in the right direction. This helps make sure everyone&#8217;s working towards the same goals and gets the best results.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>2. Use Virtual Environments:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use virtual environments like virtualenv or venv to make separate spaces for Python projects. This keeps things organized and prevents problems when different projects need different things. It also makes sure that the work stays the same from when it&#8217;s being made to when it&#8217;s being tested and used for real.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>3. Follow PEP 8 Guidelines:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow the rules in Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 8 for writing code that&#8217;s easy to read and work with. Make sure to use the same style throughout, give variables names that make sense, and organize the code in a way that makes sense. This helps make sure that everyone can understand and work on the code without any problems.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>4. Leverage Pythonic Idioms:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Python&#8217;s own ways of doing things to write code that&#8217;s short, works well, and follows Python&#8217;s style. Choose list comprehensions instead of loops, use context managers to handle resources, and use the tools that Python already has to make the code easier to read and run faster. This makes sure that the code is written in the best way for utilizing the power of Python and gets things done quickly and efficiently.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>5. Automate Testing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tools like pytest or unit test to automatically check if the code works right. Write tests for small parts of the code, how different parts work together, and how everything works as a whole. This helps make sure the code does what it&#8217;s supposed to do, works well, and doesn&#8217;t have any problems when changes are made. It also helps with keeping track of changes and making sure everything runs smoothly when putting the code into action.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>6. Document Code Effectively:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write comments in the code that explain what&#8217;s happening in a simple and clear way. Use special comments called docstrings to explain what each part of the code does and why it&#8217;s there. Make sure all the comments follow the same style, and use tools like Sphinx to make big documents that explain everything about the project in detail. This helps other people understand the code better and makes it easier to work together.</span><b></b></p>

<hr />
<h3><b>7. Optimize Performance:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find and fix problems that make the code slow using tools like cProfile or line_profiler. Make parts of the code that are really important work faster, use ways of storing data and doing things that work well, and use tricks to remember results from before to make things faster. This helps the code run better and handle more work without slowing down.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>8. Monitor and Debug Applications:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up ways to keep an eye on how the program is working and find problems as soon as they happen. Use tools to check what&#8217;s happening in the program, figure out what went wrong, and fix any issues quickly. Use special tools to look at the code step by step, check what values different parts of the code have, and find out what&#8217;s causing any bugs or problems. This helps make sure the program works well and that any issues get fixed quickly.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>9. Stay Up-to-Date with Python Ecosystem:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay updated on what&#8217;s new and best in the world of Python. Read forums where Python users talk, go to conferences, and join meetings where people talk about Python. This helps you learn about new things, like excellent tools and ways of doing things, that can help you make new stuff in the digital world.</span><b></b></p>

<h2><b>Common Challenges in CRM Implementation </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing a CRM system, such as Salesforce, for business, can bring many benefits, but it&#8217;s not without challenges. There can be pitfalls related to lack of expertise, data migration, unforeseen complexities, customization requirements, etc. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39507 aligncenter" title="Navigating Challenges in CRM Implementation" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Navigating-Challenges-in-CRM-Implementation.jpg" alt="Navigating Challenges in CRM Implementation" width="800" height="637" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Navigating-Challenges-in-CRM-Implementation.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Navigating-Challenges-in-CRM-Implementation-300x239.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Navigating-Challenges-in-CRM-Implementation-768x612.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Navigating-Challenges-in-CRM-Implementation-480x382.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s track them down and understand the roadblocks businesses can anticipate while implementing CRM: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Complexity of Implementation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Integrating a CRM system into existing workflows can be difficult, especially for businesses with complex processes. Without proper guidance, navigating the intricacies of Salesforce implementation can be overwhelming.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lack of Internal Expertise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: While Salesforce offers robust features and capabilities, harnessing its full potential requires specialized knowledge. Many businesses lack in-house expertise to handle the complexities of Salesforce implementation effectively. To overcome this, businesses often seek mentorship from Digital Transformation Services for expertise and efficiency. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data Migration Challenges:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Migrating data from legacy systems to Salesforce can be complex and time-consuming. Data accuracy and integrity during migration is crucial to avoid disruptions to business operations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>User Adoption Issues</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Even the most advanced CRM system is only effective if users embrace it. Poor user adoption can undermine the success of Salesforce implementation. Employees may resist change or struggle to adapt to the new system without proper training and support.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Customization Requirements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Off-the-shelf Salesforce solutions may not always meet the unique needs of every business. Customization is often necessary to tailor Salesforce to specific workflows and requirements. However, without the right expertise, businesses may struggle to customize Salesforce effectively.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses often turn to Salesforce implementation consulting services to overcome these limitations and maximize the advantages of Salesforce implementation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These experts are crucial in guiding businesses through the implementation process, providing strategic guidance, technical expertise, and hands-on support.</span></p>

<h2><b>Getting Started with Customization</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customization is key when harnessing the full potential of Salesforce for business. Customizing Salesforce lets you tailor the platform to fit your unique business needs and workflows, maximizing its effectiveness and driving business success.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39508 aligncenter" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Initiating-Customization-Getting-Started.jpg" alt="Initiating Customization Getting Started" width="800" height="532" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Initiating-Customization-Getting-Started.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Initiating-Customization-Getting-Started-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Initiating-Customization-Getting-Started-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Initiating-Customization-Getting-Started-480x319.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><b>But where do you begin? Let&#8217;s break it down:</b></p>
<h3><b>Assess Your Needs </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before getting into customization, assessing your business requirements and objectives is essential. Take time to identify the pain points, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement within your current processes. Consider factors such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Specific Business Goals</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: What are your primary objectives for implementing Salesforce? Whether it&#8217;s improving sales processes, enhancing customer service, or streamlining marketing efforts, defining clear goals will guide your customization strategy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Workflow Analysis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Analyze your existing workflows to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Where are the pain points? What tasks could be automated or streamlined with Salesforce?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>User Feedback:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gather input from key stakeholders and end-users to understand their needs and preferences. What features or functionalities are essential to their roles? What challenges do they face with the current systems?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above questions will help identify your business requirements for Salesforce customizations. You can also seek assistance from Custom CRM Software Services to do this efficiently and implement the right customization strategies. </span></p>
<h3><b>Understand Salesforce Capabilities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before beginning the customization, familiarize yourself with Salesforce&#8217;s capabilities and features. Salesforce is a robust platform with many tools and functionalities to support various business processes. Some key components to explore include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Standard Objects</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Salesforce offers standard objects such as Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, and Cases, which serve as building blocks for your CRM system.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Custom Objects: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides standard objects, Salesforce allows you to create custom objects to track unique data specific to your business.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Automation Tools</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Use Salesforce&#8217;s automation tools, such as Workflow Rules, Process Builder, and Flow, to automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Integration Options:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Salesforce integrates seamlessly with various third-party applications and enterprise systems. Explore integration possibilities to enhance functionality and connectivity across your ecosystem.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Plan Your Customization Strategy</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a clear understanding of your needs and Salesforce&#8217;s capabilities, it&#8217;s time to develop a customization strategy. Consider the following steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prioritize Customizations:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Identify the most critical customizations based on your business goals and priorities. Focus on high-impact changes that will deliver the most significant value to your organization.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create a Roadmap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Develop a phased approach to customization, breaking down the process into manageable milestones. Prioritize customizations based on complexity, dependencies, and business impact.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Engage Salesforce Consulting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Consider partnering with <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/salesforce/consulting" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">Expert Salesforce Consulting</a> to guide you through the customization process. Salesforce consultants bring valuable expertise and experience to help you make right decisions and avoid common pitfalls.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Implement and Iterate</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&#8217;ve mapped out your customization strategy, it&#8217;s time to implement it. Implement customizations systematically, following best practices and guidelines provided by Salesforce. Be sure to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Test Thoroughly: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test customizations rigorously to ensure they meet your requirements and function as intended. Solicit feedback from end-users and stakeholders throughout the testing process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Train Users:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Provide comprehensive training to end-users to familiarize them with the customized Salesforce environment. Empower users to take full advantage of the new features and functionalities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Monitor and Iterate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Continuously monitor the performance of your customizations and gather user feedback. Iterate your customization strategy based on insights and evolving business needs.</span></li>

<h2><b>Factors to Consider When Budgeting for Your MVP</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing an accurate budget for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requires thoughtful planning and analysis. When estimating your MVP costs, be sure to evaluate these key factors:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-38885 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Essential-MVP-Development-Costs-1024x352.png" alt="Essential MVP Development Costs" width="876" height="301" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Essential-MVP-Development-Costs-1024x352.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Essential-MVP-Development-Costs-300x103.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Essential-MVP-Development-Costs-768x264.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Essential-MVP-Development-Costs-1536x529.png 1536w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Essential-MVP-Development-Costs-2048x705.png 2048w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Essential-MVP-Development-Costs-480x165.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /></p>
<p><b>1. Core feature se</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">t: Resist the temptation to build out every possible feature in your initial launch. Carefully identify the absolute minimum set of features that will validate your hypothesis with early adopters. After you&#8217;ve proven product-market fit, additional features can be added in later iterations. Focusing on a narrow feature set first will help control development costs.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Development team size</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: More developers working in parallel will speed up build time but increase costs. Consider starting with a small, nimble team of 1-3 developers to keep costs down initially. Ramp up as needed after launch.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Technical complexity:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Simple, streamlined technologies will require less development effort than complex stacks. Prioritize simplicity, especially in your MVP. Complex tech can come later.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Design complexity<span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly customized designs are more expensive than simple, clean UI/UX. Start simple. Seek a company offering <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/product-ui-ux-design" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">UI/UX Design Services</a> like ValueCoders to avoid design complexiities.</span></b></p>
<p><b>5. Location</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Development costs vary widely across different regions. Take time to research affordable talent globally.</span></p>
<p><b>6. Development methodology:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Waterfall development is high-risk for early-stage products. Agile methods add flexibility to pivot quickly based on user feedback.</span></p>
<p><b>7. In-house vs outsourced</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In-house development adds overhead but tighter control. Outsourced consulting offers flexibility but less oversight. Evaluate the tradeoffs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking the time to thoroughly evaluate these key factors will give you the insights needed to build an accurate MVP budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Remember, the goal of your MVP is to maximize learnings, not deliver a perfect product. Careful planning and budgeting will help you achieve that goal without overspending.</b></span></p>

<h2><strong>Monitoring and Adjusting Your Budget</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Successfully launching and iterating an MVP requires diligent budget oversight from start to finish. Carefully monitor your actual spending compared to estimates and make adjustments as needed.</span></p>

<p><b>1. Work Closely With Your Team</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: During development, work closely with your team to keep projects on budget. </span></p>
<p><b>2. Review Progress</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Review progress regularly and watch for scope creep that may inflate costs. If certain features start to look more expensive than planned, consider descoping or deferring them. Making small course corrections during the build process is easier than major cuts late in the game.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Track Hourly Billing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Track hourly billing from outsourced teams closely for inefficiencies. If costs start trending higher than expected, address it immediately to avoid a nasty surprise down the road. </span></p>
<p><b>4. Onboard Experts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Consider bringing on an experienced project manager to monitor spending and team productivity if needed.</span></p>
<p><b>5. Keep a Close Eye on Contingency Funds</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: As you get closer to launch, keep a close eye on contingency funds and tap into them conservatively. Try to avoid letting your core features consume contingency money. Those funds are better reserved for unexpected emergencies.</span></p>
<p><b>6. Consider User Feedback</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Post-launch, iterate carefully based on user feedback. </span></p>
<p><b>7. Stick to MVP Principles</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Add features strategically, not simply because they are requested. Stick to your MVP principles; only build what is needed to support key learnings at each phase. </span></p>
<p><b>8. Monitor Closely</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Monitor closely for low-value features that don’t align with your hypotheses; these are areas to cut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ongoing monitoring provides the data needed to adjust your budget over time. Being disciplined about aligning spending with your MVP goals will allow you to further invest in the features that show traction while phasing out those that do not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With careful management of your MVP budget, each iteration will move you closer to product-market fit. You can also </span>Hire MVP Software Developers who can guide you in efficiently adjusting your budge.</p>

<h2><strong>Real-World Case Studies</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examining real-world case studies is a fantastic way to gain insights into the practical application of MVP Cost Planning. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These examples showcase how businesses have successfully used Minimum Viable Product (MVP) strategies to manage their costs while achieving their goals. Let&#8217;s explore a couple of such cases:</span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Airbnb</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Challenge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Airbnb initially faced the challenge of attracting both hosts and guests to their platform, all while managing MVP Cost Planning.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Solution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: They created a basic website with minimal features to test their concept. This MVP allowed them to validate the idea without massive development expenses.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Outcome</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Airbnb&#8217;s MVP was a success, leading to gradual expansion and feature enhancements as they gained traction. This cost-effective approach played a significant role in their growth.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. Dropbox</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Challenge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Dropbox wanted to offer cloud storage solutions in a competitive market without overcommitting resources.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Solution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: They launched a simple MVP that allowed users to upload and share files, focusing on the core functionality while keeping MVP Cost Planning in check.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Outcome</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Dropbox&#8217;s MVP gained early adopters and valuable feedback, enabling them to refine their product iteratively while avoiding unnecessary costs. Today, they are a major player in cloud storage.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. Twitter</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Challenge:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Twitter aimed to create a platform for short, real-time updates and conversations, but they needed to ensure scalability and minimize initial development costs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Solution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: They launched a basic MVP with limited features, focusing on microblogging and following users. This approach allowed them to test their concept while keeping MVP Cost Planning in check.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Outcome:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Twitter&#8217;s MVP quickly gained popularity, helping them secure additional funding for further development. They iteratively added features while maintaining a cost-effective approach, becoming a prominent social media platform.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. Instagram</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Challenge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Instagram sought to provide a photo-sharing platform with a unique user experience, but they needed to validate their idea without overextending resources.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Solution</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: They launched a simple MVP with core features like photo sharing, filters, and social interactions. This MVP approach allowed them to gauge user interest while controlling development costs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Outcome</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Instagram&#8217;s MVP gained a devoted user base and investor interest, leading to their acquisition by Facebook. They continued to evolve their product with careful MVP Cost Planning, maintaining a lean approach.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By starting with a Minimum Viable Product, they minimized risk while gaining valuable user feedback to guide further development. These cases highlight the effectiveness of this strategy in managing costs and achieving long-term success in various </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">Digital transformation has become a critical need for businesses due to reasons’ like improving customers loyalty, driving sales, and gaining meaningful insights. All of these aspects motivate companies to embrace digital transformation strategies and invest in modern technologies.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In the current world, the importance of digital transformation can’t be understated. It’s time to take it from a concept and make it real in your company by investing in new technologies or processes that will better serve customers’ needs, which are what will help attract them even more so than before because you’re providing an experience they need instead just giving away something for free as many companies do nowadays!</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/667/0*znANQ04IkaFsR2ps" data-image-id="0*znANQ04IkaFsR2ps" data-width="1024" data-height="627" /></figure>

<p class="graf graf--p"><em><strong>Are you wondering why I should embrace digital transformation?</strong> </em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><em><strong>Actually, there are so many reasons compelling businesses to embrace digital transformation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For any company looking to make the leap into a digital economy, one of its key components must be customer service. And when it comes down to making customers feel understood and appreciated for who they are as individuals with needs that go beyond what can be solved by software or hardware alone? It’s not only important but absolutely necessary in order to achieve total success.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A successful business thrives on happy clients — which means understanding them better than anyone else does right off the bat because you’re going up against competitors just like yourself vying over those sweet spots where people spend most freely (and often).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">From all of this, it is clear that digital transformation is very critical for businesses in this age to thrive and continue making business. That’s the reason digital transformation consulting is highly sought-after. Among all of this, AI is expanding its reach and providing various incredible solutions for different applications.</p>

<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">1. Better Understanding Into Customer’s Preference</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">AI is helping to more precisely define customers’ preferences and needs, leading them into a deep understanding of who they are. This allows organizations that succeed with digital transformation projects from the beginning have better customer loyalty rates as well as improved satisfied clients based on having an accurate persona-based marketing strategy in place at launch time.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">AI helps companies get closer than ever before by looking beyond surface-level similarities between people while also analyzing potential problems or barriers before it’s too late!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Digital transformation consultant</strong> tells that by using artificial intelligence tools like IBM Cognitive Business Analytics, which uses big data analysis techniques including machine learning algorithms, among others, organizations can make sure there won’t be any bumps along with your strive to embrace it.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">2. Predict Customer Behaviour &amp; Trends</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The use of AI-based algorithms is making it possible to create propensity models by persona, and they are invaluable for predicting which customers will act on a bundling or pricing offer.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">By definition, a propensity model relies on predictive analytics, including machine learning, that predicts the probability an individual has in purchasing certain products based on their previous actions with other companies’ marketing campaigns leading them towards conversion rates such as conversions upsell/cross-sell, etc.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Propensity models have proven themselves very effective at increasing customer retention while reducing churn percentages because not only does all this help you retain your current clientele but also potentially attract new ones through better targeting techniques via characterizing each person’s personality type so there can be more relevant communication.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">3. Data-Driven Marketing Insights</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">AI has made it possible for businesses and marketers alike to take advantage of data-driven marketing tactics. Data-driven strategies are becoming the forefront in identifying your customers’ needs as well as predicting their future behaviour with greater accuracy than ever before, all without human intervention!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">When a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">digital transformation company</strong> uses AI to bring in more data-driven insight, it ensures that it brings the most optimal &amp; accurate insight. The power behind artificial intelligence also enables companies like Facebook &amp; YouTube who rely on ads to provide better targeting options which lead us into an era where cost efficiency can be observed across key tasks such as media buying or even customer service responses. It all happened just because of AI.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/07/07/10-charts-that-will-change-your-perspective-of-ai-in-marketing/?sh=666d52e62d03" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/07/07/10-charts-that-will-change-your-perspective-of-ai-in-marketing/?sh=666d52e62d03" data-wpel-link="external">Image source</a></span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A new technology called AI can be used by producers to increase their sales. The use of machine learning allows for the analysis and presentation on why consumers are not buying certain products, as well as what they might need in order make up these purchases more easily accessible through an innovative design that caters specifically towards them with lower costs associated due to efficiency gains from decreased waste production.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">4. More Consolidated Security</strong></h3>
<p>AI is revolutionizing how organizations digitally transform their security strategies. This is because the threats to customers’ identities and personal data continue to proliferate. It’s rare you hear any digital transformation strategy prioritize securing people over Programs or Processes (PIPs).</p>
<p>However, the exception maybe with the BMC ADE framework, which recognizes just how integral it can potentially become in order to attain that positive customer experience — one thing they want more than anything else!</p>
<p>The reason for this change comes down not only from an increased need among businesses these days. Instead, it is because of the individuals who are already so wary after many high-profile hacking scandals. It is where consumers had sensitive information leaked online without even knowing about them beforehand except through other means such as articles.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">5. Seamless Customer Service</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The future of customer service is AI-powered. Gartner reports that companies who embed artificial intelligence into their engagement centres will experience a 25% increase in operational efficiency while also revolutionizing how care is provided for customers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A perfect use case gave the lack or limited data available on current contexts via digital transformations strategies within eCommerce sites or brick-and-mortar stores where people can be served remotely if the need arises; this information would make all aspects more insightful and better tailored towards individual needs.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-10-digital-transformation-companies-you-must-consult-to-adapt-modern-tech/?utm_source=Top_Digi_Trans&amp;utm_medium=Digi_Tran_Str&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_22890" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Digital transformation companies in India</strong></a> are testing the capabilities of AI for customer services in different industries by implementing customer interest tracking and chatbot.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">6. Better Decision Making</strong></h3>
<p>For many businesses, the process of making decisions is difficult. With so much data available and no time left in their day for sifting through all this valuable information. So, it becomes hard to know what should be done next with your company. In fact, there are other things you wish could get back onto the track like marketing efforts or sales goals that haven’t yet been.</p>
<p>It is reached by way of prioritization discussions among employees at headquarters (or wherever). When using artificial intelligence as an innovative toolkit within these types of decision-making processes. It will not only let managers find themselves more confident about future prospects due. Besides, a deft <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">digital transformation consultant</strong> can help you curate better ways to employ it for organizational decision-making.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">7. Tracking &amp; Traceability</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The power of artificial intelligence is amazing. It can be used to identify patterns in large scopes data, helping organizations improve where needed with minimal time investment and providing insights about an organization that might otherwise go unnoticed or unheeded by those involved.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The benefits being derived from AI-powered systems are numerous: identifying inefficient processes while also saving money on unnecessary costs; gaining visibility into entities who have been previously difficult for managers to oversee due to their geographical dispersion across the globe (no matter how small); Improving decision-making abilities through automation which reduces human error rates significantly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Owing to that, most supply chain companies embrace <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/digital-transformation-services?utm_source=Digi_Trans&amp;utm_medium=Digi_Tran_Str&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_22890" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">digital transformation consulting</strong></a> to leverage AI to improve their workflow.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">8. Empowering People</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">There is a strong fear that the rise of AI might be humanity’s end. But it couldn’t be much further from reality. Though still an emerging technology with limitations and vulnerabilities in its programming. And, it needs to improve for humans as well as other machines alike.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Artificial intelligence could potentially make our lives easier by making things more efficient or personalized at times depending on what tasks need doing — including those involving Digital Transformations such as ones where we’ll see faster processes achieved through automation, saving time &amp; money while empowering people along the way too.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So ultimately, both sides benefit. Humans get their jobs done better than ever before.  Thanks largely due-in part because there will no longer have been any human effort required. And AIso who now have greater autonomy over how they do.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">9. Improved IT Infrastructure</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Evergreen IT infrastructure and integration is the new standard. This is because organizations capitalize on insights gained from AI to better scale customer experiences. Flexible, quickly adapting systems are needed for every aspect of a company’s supply chain: supplier onboarding; quality management (in case something goes wrong); strategic sourcing — getting an edge over competitors because you know what they need before it does!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This means updating your ERP or purchasing platform with features like voice recognition software. Hence, employees don’t have to take orders orally anymore-and maybe even use facial recognition at some point too.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">10. Cost Reduction &amp; Higher Productivity</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">AI is making a significant impact on the manufacturing industry.  It is reducing up to 20% of the conversion costs. New research from BCG suggests that producers will get more productivity. This will also help to generate additional sales.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is because they can develop innovative AI products tailored for specific customer needs in shorter lead times. These products are based on the process automation concept that uses computer vision algorithms or related technologies like machine learning.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Wrapping Up</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Keeping customers, employees and partners informed about digital transformation initiatives is a good way to earn trust. In these uncertain times, transparency matters more than ever before. Hence, organizations should be transparent with their communication plan when creating any new framework or strategy. It will help them to fit well alongside COVID-19 pandemic response frameworks.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The Modeling Framework is an excellent example of maintaining vendor relationships during public health emergencies. If you want to leverage AI to carve a mind-blowing digital marketing strategy, you should adapt for digital transformation services. However, you need to ensure to connect with a digital transformation company deft in employing artificial intelligence in different scenarios.</p>

<h3><strong>Let’s also talk about the benefits of Digital Transformation:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global digital transformation market is expected to grow at a CAGR of</span><b> 22.7% from 2019 to touch $3,294 billion by 2025.</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">While the ROI of digital transformation depends on various factors, the right technology can significantly improve how your business functions and customer engagement?</span></p>

<h3><b>What is A Digital Transformation Framework?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design a framework that helps and manages, and seeks transformation will go a long way ahead. The model maintains a balance between seven elements: strategy, structure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">systems, skills, shared values, style, and staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn how you borrow from proven management models. You’ll witness that creating a digital transformation network IS EASIER THAN THOUGHT.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-19956" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sfgsgf.png" alt="digital transformation network" width="456" height="433" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sfgsgf.png 622w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/sfgsgf-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since digital transformation has many aspects&#8212;&#8212;- training, technology, people, etc.&#8212;If you’re aiming for a new tool(system), you can overlook the need for additional employee training(skills,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">staff).</span></p>
<h3><strong>Challenges of Digital Transformation </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, transformation is not only about riding a Lamborghini on an expressway. It can have some hurdles and challenges too. You might need a problem you need to fix. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you identify challenges, you can determine which part of your business needs dedicated attention.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping abreast with technology</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing productivity &amp; maintaining quality</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Becoming more competitive in the industry</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spike in sales/profit</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>How To Drive Digital Transformation?</b></h3>
<p><b>Clarity &amp; Commitment </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cut-throat competition, making strategy does wonder to your digital fortunes—Digital marketing is one of the trades that often require cross-financing, flexible decisions, and causing delays. By adopting digital metrics into business-unit goals, investors can seek cross-functional alignment and commitment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital versions are often unclear as the evolving nature of technology keeps everyone on their toes. Using the right metrics, one can unblock resistance to change as a significant software major firm. By switching the metrics to units sold, the company creates a spike in sales rate to drive the business ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you are firm with your ideas &amp; beliefs. In that case, you can look for </span>digital transformation consulting services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give a catastrophic result and ensure your ideas &amp; strategies complement your goals.</span></p>
<p><b>Workplace Of The Future </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So What does it mean? Creating the workforce of the future means planning for the dynamic future. The transition of the flexible and scalable resource models is helpful in &#8212;-the investment of digital skill development and remodeling workplace scenarios where technology augments each other in customer-facing aspects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital affects organizations at functional, operational, and resource levels, often in the most astonishing manner. Mid-size office supplies help switch to a customer relationship management (CRM) platform initiates a series of unanticipated changes, including setting up a new sales operations function, outsourcing unmanaged sales, reorganizing key accounts, making external hires, and re-aligning roles &amp; responsibilities across various customer-facing parts.</span></p>
<p><b>Digital Portfolio </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to imagine a </span>digital transformation service<span style="font-weight: 400;"> company without a website, mobile app, social media presence, and essential digital toolkits. Since it is necessary to stay relevant and competent, each company must go further to ask. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to exploit newer technologies to make a stronghold in the market? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge for native digital businesses is to reap benefits from all available channels; however, it is a brick-and-mortar business; the challenge is how to harness the advantages of multi-platform traffic. What is the right digital/physical mix for your business?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous research &amp; development results in advanced personalization, learning intelligence, and implementation expertise, transforming the product into a profitable software-as-a-service portfolio.</span></p>
<p><b>Digital Marketplace</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital participation is equally important if you want to enhance the digital economy. It needs foresight, leadership, speed, and sharp business. Making the right decisions in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the nick of time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> determines competitiveness and profitability. Leaders worldwide hold critical positions in shaping the digital economy by providing thought leadership, building advocacy, and engagement with digital communities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology development cycles shrink and tech-biased Millennials drive consumption and business decisions, it will compel them to digitize continuously. Therefore, it is to re-position digital transformation as a sustainable investment strategy much like product R&amp;D, rather than a one-time fix aimed at bolting the latest technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A longer-term view will shift the focus to building the critical underlying capabilities needed to thrive in the digital economy, which many companies lack today.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Different Stages of Digital Transformation </strong></h3>
<p>Together, the six stages provide a guide for purposeful, results-driven transformation initiatives.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Business as usual, status quo</strong> — The current state of your organization</span></p>

<h3><b>How to Measure ROI on Digital Transformation?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital transformations require investments of both time and money, so it’s essential to have a system in place to measure the return on investment (ROI).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To establish how you’ll measure and track your digital transformation’s success, follow these three steps: </span>A digital transformation consulting firm<span style="font-weight: 400;"> can go a long way ahead in meeting ROI goals.</span></p>
<p><b>Set goals </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">— What does success mean to you? What is your ideal outcome?</span></p>
<p><b>Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — What metrics will you monitor? How will those metrics tell the story of your digital transformation? What level of KPI growth are you hoping to achieve?</span></p>

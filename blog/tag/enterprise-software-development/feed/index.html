<h3><strong>1. Security and Compliance</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintechs must embed security and compliance across their technology landscape &#8211; in applications collecting sensitive customer data, APIs transmitting financial transactions, cloud servers storing account details, analytics tools processing data, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong Fintech enterprise architecture establishes technology frameworks for Fintech and protocols like OAuth, end-to-end encryption, MFA, key management, perimeter security, and stringent access controls. Confidential data is protected without compromising experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By codifying regulatory principles during the design phase rather than bolting on controls later, products meet compliance needs from launch.  To proactively identify control gaps, <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/enterprise-software-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">enterprise software development</a></strong> teams  constantly evaluate new privacy and data sovereignty regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating GRC tools and using infrastructure-as-code for provisioning and managing systems also improves security posture over time.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Better Customer Experiences</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People expect finance apps to be as smart and intuitive as Big Tech. EA focuses on creating personalized journeys by understanding customer pain points and mapping technology to desired experiences.</span></p>
<p><b>For instance,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> identifying the need for tracking complex investments leads to developing a dashboard with customized metrics, alerts, and commentary by linking core brokerage data with analytics tools, even bots of <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/blockchain-ml/streamlining-finance-the-benefits-of-ai-and-ml-in-fintech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">AI and ML in Fintech</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dashboard surfaces via web and mobile apps, meeting omnichannel expectations. Leveraging cloud and micro-frontends allows feature enhancement without rewriting entire applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">APIs connect frontends to required services such as accounts, transactions, market data analysis, and predictions seamlessly in the background. Strong integration architecture prevents broken journeys.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3><strong>3. Better Insights</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many fintechs miss growth opportunities hidden in their data. Architecting a strong analytics foundation helps leverage AI/ML for actionable intelligence &#8211; like alerts on payment failures, risk modeling for lending decisions, personalized investment recommendations, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EA outlines technologies supporting data pipelines &#8211; from data lakes aggregating siloed data, applying quality checks and transformations to data marts tailored for departments, to models generating insights like forecasts, customer lifetime value, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexible scaling data infrastructure allows easier correlation analysis to uncover <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/fintech-trends-in-mobile-app-development-to-watch-out-in-2020-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Fintech trends in mobile app development</a></strong>. Strategic EA develops the capability for rapid data collection from more internal and external sources &#8211; further refining insights over time.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Addressing Scalability</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To handle exponential jumps in transactions and customer data as fintechs rapidly widen their user base, the underlying systems architecture must be inherently and infinitely scalable on demand. Robust Fintech enterprise architecture centers on flexibility and distributed design rather than monoliths.</span></p>
<p><b>For instance, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">a microservices-oriented architecture allows individual functions to be upgraded by just horizontally scaling out more containerized instances to handle spikes in API traffic. Polyglot persistence ensures storage scales efficiently &#8211; hot transactional data in fast databases, while bulk data lakes use cost-optimized object storage solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serverless computing allows event-driven scaling of processing capacity according to real-time needs. Large fintechs leverage thousands of small functions stitched by resilient messaging queues. Strategic use of CDNs smoothly absorbs high traffic across globally distributed websites and apps.</span></p>
<h3><strong>5. Streamlining Operations Through Integration</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve straight-through processing across its technology landscape, a Fintech enterprise architecture focuses on API-led connectivity.  Powerful integration platform as a service (iPaaS) tools create interconnected systems that exchange data seamlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prebuilt adapters integrate legacy systems with <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/cloud-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">modern cloud solutions</a></strong> and third-party services like KYC verification, risk analysis, compliance policy updates, etc. Real-time data replication across CRUD APIs powers dynamic operational dashboards &#8211; creating a single pane of glass across systems to smooth workflows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter the variety of origination sources &#8211; bank records, mobile transactions, web forms, etc. &#8211; strongly buffered message queues absorb data, allowing asynchronous processing for resilience. Events trigger relevant workflows in downstream systems using integration middleware.</span></p>
<h3><strong>6. Innovation and Technology Adoption</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than playing catch up, a <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/industries/fintech-software-development-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Fintech software development company</a> </strong>must track emerging technologies and rapidly prototype new solutions before competitors. However, rebuilding entire Fintech technology stacks inhibits experimentation velocity and heightens risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech Enterprise architecture emphasizes progressive modernization &#8211; abstracting legacy complexity behind well-documented APIs allows <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">skilled developers</a></strong> to consume core services while innovating in parallel. New UI layers integrate microfrontends. Cloud native stacks scale robustly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service mesh routing directs traffic, that allows testing of experimental microservices with a subset of users first.  Infrastructure-as-code templates ease replication of production environments for ops. Gradually transitioning to event-driven, serverless systems centered around data streams aids in adopting ML.</span></p>

<h3><strong>7. Cost Efficiency and Resource Optimization</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While agility and resilience have a cost, strategic enterprise architecture protects against overspending. Beyond storage/bandwidth optimization, steering focus from Capex investments towards more Opex reduces TCO while maintaining flexibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinOps frameworks to track cloud resource utilization in real time &#8211; identifying idle and underutilized components for deprovisioning. Auto-scaling ensures expenditure follows demand contours tightly. Workload placement decisions optimize latency and data gravity considerations, balancing performance with pricing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These steps will help you with not just the development but also with ERP system architecture or integration. So, let’s find out: </span></p>
<p><b>1. Initial Planning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: First, you must begin with a comprehensive assessment of your organization&#8217;s needs and objectives. Identify pain points, inefficiencies, and opportunities that the custom ERP system will address.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Development Approach</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: You must decide whether in-house development or <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-outsourcing-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software outsourcing services</a> align best with your resources and expertise. Each has its merits and considerations.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Design and Development</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A balance of design and development is crucial for successful ERP software development. Collaborate closely with <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">skilled developers</a> and designers to create a blueprint encapsulating your vision. Focus on user interface design, functionality, and scalability.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Testing and Quality Assurance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Rigorous testing ensures your custom ERP system operates flawlessly. From functionality checks to security audits, this phase is paramount.</span></p>
<p><b>5. Deployment and User Training</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Roll out your custom ERP system gradually to minimize disruptions. Provide comprehensive training to users to maximize adoption and ROI.</span></p>
<p><b>6. Feedback Loop:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Establish an ongoing feedback mechanism for users to report issues and suggest improvements. Observe and monitor to know if ERP software customization is required. Custom ERP development is a continuous journey of refinement.</span></p>
<p><b>7. Integration Strategy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ensure seamless ERP system integration with existing software and data sources. Data consistency and accuracy are non-negotiable.</span></p>
<p><b>8. Data Migration</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Migrate data from legacy systems to the new ERP smoothly. Data integrity is pivotal for informed decision-making.</span></p>
<p><b>9. Maintenance and Support</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Enlist a dedicated team for ongoing ERP system maintenance, updates, and user support to keep your system operating at its peak.</span></p>
<p><b>10. Cost Considerations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Track and manage custom ERP costs throughout development, including initial investments and long-term operational expenses.</span></p>

Ensure you have a detailed breakdown of these expenses.</span></p>
<p><b>#2. License and Subscription Fees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Factor in ERP software licensing fees and ongoing subscription costs. Some ERP solutions charge on a per-user common challenges.</span></p>
<p><b>#3. Implementation Costs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Beyond software costs, you should also consider expenses related to the implementation process, such as data migration, integration with existing systems, and employee training.</span></p>
<p><b>#4. Maintenance and Support</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Budget for ongoing maintenance and support, which may include software updates, troubleshooting, and helpdesk services. These are essential for system longevity.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Insufficient Planning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Rushing into ERP development without a well-defined plan can misalign your business needs.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Scope Creep</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Beware of scope creep, where the project gradually expands beyond the initial scope.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Inadequate User Involvement:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> User input is invaluable. Failing to involve end-users in the design and testing phases can result in an ERP system that doesn&#8217;t meet their needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Poor Data Management</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Neglecting data migration and quality can disrupt operations. Ensure meticulous data cleansing and migration strategies are in place.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Overlooking Change Management</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Employees need support adapting to the new system. Neglecting change management can lead to resistance and reduced adoption rates.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Not Evaluating ROI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Regularly measure the return on investment (ROI) to ensure the ERP system delivers the expected benefits and justifies the investment.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ignoring Regulatory Compliance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Industries like healthcare and finance have specific regulations. Neglecting compliance can result in legal consequences and operational disruptions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Neglecting Post-Launch Support:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The project isn&#8217;t over at launch. Plan ongoing support and maintenance to address issues and optimize the system.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Overlooking Scalability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ensure your ERP system can scale with your business. Failing to consider scalability can lead to costly system replacements down the line.</span></li>

<h3><b>Let&#8217;s Have A Quick Look At The Latest Statistics</b></h3>

<h2><b>Why Do Businesses Need Software Development Methodology?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be productive and successful in your business, you need to know exactly what you want to accomplish and how you plan to do it. Without clear goals and a concrete plan, it’s easy to lose focus, which results in wasted time and resources. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25078 size-full" title="development methodology" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/development-methodology.png" alt="development methodology" width="486" height="499" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/development-methodology.png 486w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/development-methodology-292x300.png 292w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Img src: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, software development methodologies can help you create this framework that will keep you on track throughout the project’s lifetime. Here we have elaborated on the reasons why your business needs software development methodologies:</span></p>
<h3><b>1) To Make Sure Everyone Is On The Same Page</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a team is creating software, all members must have a common understanding of how things will be done. For example, if you’re working on a project intended to process transactions as fast as possible, everyone needs to know what as fast as possible means. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure team members understand their roles and responsibilities, they should be provided with detailed requirements and objectives that outline project specifics.</span></p>
<h3><b>2) To Ensure There Are No Miscommunications</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication acts as a two-way street: as much as you want your team to understand what you want, you also need to understand what they need. To get their input, ask open-ended questions that don’t force them into yes/no answers; ask what if? Questions that leave room for multiple scenarios; and brainstorming together. Don’t be afraid to give constructive criticism, too—the best solutions are often created through an iterative process.</span></p>
<h3><b>3) To Make Sure You Deliver What You Promise To Your Customers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All too often, businesses fail to deliver what they promise to their customers. In many cases, companies don’t start with a clear roadmap of what they need to do. By developing a methodology for software development, you can create an organized and consistent approach for building your product or service.</span></p>
<h3><b>4) To Help You Avoid Costly Mistakes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software development methodologies provide a set of rules for development, which are documented and enforced. They help you create easy-to-read and test code, ensuring accuracy and consistency. They also let you work with your team members in an organized way, minimizing duplication of effort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These things can help prevent costly errors that would otherwise arise throughout software creation. You don’t want bugs to make it into production—it’s simply not good for business!</span></p>

<h3><b>5) To Ensure You Meet Deadlines</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A deadline is a must when it comes to software development. If you don’t have set deadlines for your project, it could easily be delayed and never finished. Deadlines not only force action but also help you stay on track by giving you something to aim for and get excited about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, they provide clarity of purpose: When everyone knows what they need to accomplish within a given time frame, there’s no question about what needs to be done.</span></p>
<p><b>Example:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=webblog_development_methodology&amp;utm_medium=S05&amp;id=25073" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> software development company</a> uses an agile methodology, emphasizing fast-paced and continual innovation within each project’s time limit. Agile projects are organized in smaller timeboxes called sprints, each with a specific goal.</span></p>
<h3><b>6) To Promote Collaboration</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good methodology will encourage collaboration between different teams and individuals, improving communication and ensuring that everyone is working towards the same goal.</span></p>
<h3><b>7) To Increase Customer Satisfaction</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using a methodology that focuses on quality and efficiency, you can help to increase customer satisfaction with your software. This can lead to more repetitive business and improved brand loyalty.</span></p>

<h2><b>The Curated List Of Top Software Development Methodologies For Enterprises</b></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><b> Waterfall Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In waterfall methodologies, every step or goal needs to be met before moving on to the next part. For example &#8211; if you have five tasks that need to be completed but only three are done while one is left undone, the project can&#8217;t continue until it&#8217;s been completed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This system has several pros compared to other ones out there- for instance, it doesn&#8217;t require too much thinking and planning, which helps save time, and because it has steps laid out beforehand, there&#8217;s less room for error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main advantage of the waterfall model is its predictability. Because each stage is completed before moving on to the next, tracking progress and identifying potential problems early on is easy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main downside of the waterfall model is its inflexibility. Once a stage of the process has begun, it&#8217;s difficult to make changes without starting the whole process over again from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spiral methodology is also called waterfall because it follows a linear pattern without backtracking. Unlike its predecessor, though- it offers more flexibility in prototyping so that we can test new ideas earlier on in the process instead of making costly mistakes later on during the development stages.</span></p>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phases (generally described as Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Maintenance) are easy to understand and manage.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideal for less experienced teams and managers as confusion is minimized.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple rigid model keeps things clear and easy to test.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant amount of time is saved.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only focuses on precise needs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does not work well for maintenance software development projects or long-term projects.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no way to know the project&#8217;s outcome in advance.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><b> Rapid App Development Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid Application Development provides an ideal way to take maximum advantage of software with minimal investment costs. This condensed model allows quick adjustments that speed up results, and you repeat user design/construction phases until project requirements finish (stages include: requirements planning; construction). </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there&#8217;s no need to go back through all four again once something has been changed in one stage.</span></em></p>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">More useful for projects with well-defined objectives and user groups.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best for small to medium, time-sensitive projects.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitates the development process by developing high-quality projects faster.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take customer feedback for improvements and specific results.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stable team with experienced developers need for this methodology to work.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requires highly skilled developers to design complex problems.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does not work for small budgets.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><b> Agile Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This methodology makes it possible to develop software by working in small increments called iterations. It helps improve efficiency because you can find problems early on and fix them before they become bigger issues later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is known as &#8220;reducing risk&#8221; or reducing uncertainty, among other things, through testing scenarios during each stage of development (user stories).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main pros of agile software development is its flexibility. Because teams can adjust their plans, agile methodology is best for projects with rapidly changing requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main disadvantage of agile software development is that it is difficult to track progress and estimate deadlines since the project&#8217;s scope may change during the development process.</span></p>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model adapts to changes quickly.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct and regular communication maintains clarity about the project and goals.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defects and differences in expectations are detected early, so they can be corrected before they become significant problems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focusing on the details and losing sight of the &#8220;big picture&#8221; can cause the project to drift.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-time communication requires massive engagement with users and colossal manpower investment on the part of developers.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">May not work for larger organizations (a hybrid approach with another methodology may be useful).</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><b> DevOps Deployment Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Cybercrime Data analysis</h3>
<p>According to a post by <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8475-cost-of-cyberattack.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business News Daily</span></a>, cybercrime is predicted to cost $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025</p>
<p>More user engagement makes data security more vulnerable and raises cybercrime concerns. <a href="https://www.fundera.com/resources/small-business-cyber-security-statistics" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60%</span></a>% of small businesses that are victims of a cyber attack go out of business within six months</p>
<p>On the surface, cybercrime is conducted in data theft, identity fraud, ransomware attacks, phishing campaigns, copyright infringement, etc. The consequences of these attacks can lead to data breaches.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/average-cost-healthcare-data-breach-11-million/688859/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a>, the average cost of a healthcare data breach rose to around $11 million in 2023, an increase of 8% from the previous year and a 53% increase from 2020.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-30912 size-full aligncenter" title="Screenshot from 2023 05 01 18 03 13" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13.png" alt="Screenshot from 2023 05 01 18 03 13" width="896" height="561" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13.png 896w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13-300x188.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13-768x481.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" /></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p>Every type of cybercrime leads us to data breaches, and hacking is one of the most common criminal activities on the internet.</p>
<p>Hackers exploit a weakness in online communication, digital networks, or computer systems and spread malware or gain unauthorized access to data to pursue criminal activities. All actions uplift the urgency of a robust defense system to stop cyber attacks.</p>
<p>While discussing data breaching, social media also is a massive center of attraction. However, many users are skeptical about the data being used.</p>
<p>Facebook received 64,148 requests for user information from US law enforcement agencies in the second half of 2022. Germany came in second with 17 thousand requests, followed by India with 63 thousand user data requests. A total of 239 thousand requests were made throughout the measurement period</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Web Application Vulnerabilities and Threats</h3>
<p>Misconfiguration in web application code allows hackers to get control over your website. That’s why the security of software development raises concerns to address web application vulnerabilities and threats.</p>
<p>The US government’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD) shares the case studies of cybercrimes of prominent organizations.</p>

<p>Increment of 20% in email-based attacks from 2019 to 2020 as compared to web attack vectors.</p>
<p>In 2019 and 2020, Emotet was the most heavily distributed malware family. It is a botnet responsible for the distribution of Trickbot, Qbot, and more, in some cases resulting in a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>XMRig is the most attacked cryptominer, whereas Lucifer is a self-propagating, multi-platform malware targeting Linux, IoT devices, and Windows web servers.<br />
Hiddad or ‘Hidden Ad’ tops the chart of mobile malware global analysis. Through this malware, attackers can easily fetch the details from victims’ mobile by displaying ads. During COVID, the malware disguised itself as a coronavirus information app for Arab speakers.<br />
In 2020, a team of developers took 280 days to identify a cyber breach that led to the loss of nearly $4 million.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">How To Approach Secure Software Development?</h2>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Cyberattacks and enhanced data security directs companies to think about secure software development. ValueCoders is India&#8217;s leading software <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>IT outsourcing company</strong></a> that continuously addresses defects to make secure software and reduce vulnerabilities. Divide software development lifecycle into different segments starting from requirements and move to other steps, designing, implementation, and testing.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The Software Engineering Institute developed the Team Software Process (TSP), allowing software developers and developer teams to create software under a definite process. This process wants companies to focus on:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Use common sense software engineering practices</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Tackle defects throughout the software product development lifecycle</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Use proper measurement to control the process</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Track the process and address defect prevention as well as removal</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Apply predictive measures for remaining defects</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Another significant example demonstrated by Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) practices. SDL practices support security assurance and compliance requirements and also reduce the severity of vulnerabilities in software development. As per Microsoft, software developers are suggested to follow various practices:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Providing training</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Define security requirements</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Define metrics and compliance reporting</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform threat modeling</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Establish Design requirements</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Define &amp; use cryptography</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Use third-party components to manage security<span style="font-weight: 400;"> risk</span></li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Use approved tools</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST)</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform Penetration Testing</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Establish a Standard Incident Response Process</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ever-changing dynamics of the economy and technology make it hard for a CIO to meet existing enterprise demands while trying to be innovative simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This especially applies to the usage of technology in an enterprise, where leaders desire to leverage software technology to bring improvements in efficiency and performance to their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, an enterprise using conventional centralised technologies to record and maintain data is suddenly met by a demand to use new technology such as blockchain for the same.</span></p>
<p><b>In such a case, the need for using new technology will be more out of the fear of lagging behind in the latest technology trends, rather than out of necessity.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several problems such as these that create challenges in Enterprise software development. The need for seamlessly integrated enterprise software is gradually increasing as enterprises delve deeper into understanding demands at a deeper level and attempt to solve problems rarely thought about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a good reason why the enterprise software industry is expected to grow by up to 10.5% in 2020, and why it is the </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268940/percent-growth-in-it-spending-worldwide-by-segment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fastest-growing segment in the entire IT industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With new advancements and emerging technologies coming into play, </span><b>enterprises have begun to realize that human capital simply isn’t enough. </b></p>
<p>If you need evidence for the same, have a look at the chart below.</p>

Notice something here? </span><b>Investments in Enterprise Software, Tech Consulting &amp; Systems Integration Services have increased at the highest rates since 2018</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Predictions from Forrester Research echo my points- businesses are increasingly relying on technology consulting and software to enhance business processes and adapt to the modern information era.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To solve the new-age issues, businesses require enterprise systems that get routine work done in an instant, help allocate work and allot time to objectives that meet the goal of profitability and sustainability. </span></p>
<p><b>Enterprise software development in the present day is about finding problems nobody thought of before</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and creating solutions using technologies and its integrations that remove all boundaries and seamlessly integrate all functions across an enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just like one challenge I mentioned above, there are several other challenges on the road to enterprise software development that most CIOs fail to see, or just decide to hit the iceberg despite having seen it from miles ahead.</span></p>

<h2><strong>1. Creating an immersive Enterprise App without affecting Costs &amp; ROI</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above video shows how Boeing is using AR to create an immersive software application for technician training)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer Apps of the modern-day are all about enticing customers into using apps with immersive UI that deliver experiences users simply wouldn’t want to get out of. </span><b>A right swipe on a smartphone app is just a navigation gesture used to enable specific functions. But it means so much more than that on an app like Tinder.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While enterprise apps don’t need such levels of form-over-function approach as in the case of consumer-oriented apps, there is a growing demand for features that make the task of using such apps engaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating through an off-the-shelf <a href="https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/buyer-guide/applicant-tracking-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">ATS (Applicant Tracking Software) software</a> that gives you bland notifications on suitable job candidates can get boring after a time. But adding a human element to it, say with a hyperactive AI bot that provides such information in a conversational way changes the entire experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But can immersive experiences with enterprise software justify the costs potentially incurred to add such features?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not in the short term, but definitely in the longer run. A one-time focus on creating a seamlessly integrated design of the entire systems ecosystem adds to the enterprise value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an employee is used to operating one enterprise system software (which has an immersive, engaging UX) for their job-related purposes, they&#8217;ll find it much easier to adapt to other enterprise software that&#8217;s part of the organization ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fact is already proven in the realm of consumer software and apps. </span><b>If you use an Apple iPhone, you&#8217;ll likely find it easier to navigate through other Apple devices such as an iPad or a MacBook.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you use an office application suite such as the Google G Suite or Microsoft Office 365, then you&#8217;d know how easy it is to recognize, understand and navigate through their individual apps owing to the familiarity in them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This practice of making users addicted to an ecosystem works so well that a Forrester report estimated revenue generation of  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100 for every $1 spent on UX</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in consumer-focused apps!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But enterprise software is an entirely different ball game where each feature, each addition is meant to enhance productivity and increase efficiency rather than entice its users, i.e., those working for the enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why things are a bit rough if you consider increasing costs to build immersive experiences in enterprise software. </span><b>Increasing costs is only justified if a new design approach helps in achieving certain objectives. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some great examples of enterprises that have managed to do this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take for instance, how Boeing achieved a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">40 percent increase in productivity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by using AR for providing electrical installation training to employees. Or how Walmart increased its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee retention rates by 10%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after introducing VR-powered employee training programs.</span></p>
<p><b>By leveraging AR and VR into their employee training software ecosystem, these two companies (Boeing &amp; Walmart) highlight how investing in an immersive enterprise application using emerging technologies can justify costs involved and result in significant ROI at the same time.</b></p>
<h2><strong>2. Understanding the long-run approach</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13261" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-2.png" alt="" width="426" height="512" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-2.png 426w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-2-250x300.png 250w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys such as those done by Apple’s subsidiary FileMaker suggest that enterprises are witnessing increased ROI from their custom apps</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I have mentioned before, enterprise systems and software are particularly meant to enhance organizational productivity and performance across the entire internal business environment. But obviously, it is an expense, and expenses need to be recovered sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Enterprise Software, getting any ROI out of the project is only possible in the long-term. That’s because their benefits do not take shape immediately after deployment. They take time. In fact, an enterprise may require further investments to train employees on using the new software, especially if the software is integrated across multiple departments of the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if the market trends are any indication, most enterprise software is likely to generate decent ROI in the longer run. </span><b>Market research by FileMaker (a subsidiary of Apple) in the years 2016 and 2018 revealed an interesting trend. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its research in the year 2016, over </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">60 percent of enterprises reported positive ROI</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after investing in custom enterprise software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">percentage increased to 76%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with enterprises reporting significant ROI after integrating custom software across their business line. </span></p>
<p><b>The fact that enterprises are able to justify their expenses on custom enterprise software is surprising given the fact that<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=custom_13256_a24&amp;utm_campaign=sme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> custom software development</a> is generally an expensive affair as compared to using off-the-shelf software.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings me to define another challenge in Enterprise Software Development, which is…</span></p>
<h2><strong>3. Choosing between Custom Enterprise Software Vs. Off-the-Shelf Software</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13262" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-3.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-3.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-3-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information Source: </span><a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/marketing/state-of-it/report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spiceworks State of IT report- 2020</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Off-the-shelf software is a highly convenient solution for CIOs aiming to solve a few inefficiencies and integrate a few functions using enterprise software. However, they come with their own share of drawbacks too.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, off-the-shelf software may come with a lot of redundant features that may never be used by an organization. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, a business using off-the-shelf enterprise software has to formulate its functions centered around the software instead of the other way around.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have seen some enterprises fall victim to the second drawback I just mentioned. One firm I worked with had to </span><b>design their entire employee attendance policies around an off-the-shelf attendance tracking software! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">That happened only because they weren&#8217;t able to customize the software configuration as per their policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, some off-the-shelf enterprise software comes with heavy customization capabilities, but those only add up to the size they take and consequently require more hardware resources to perform at the optimum level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, there are certain advantages when using custom enterprise software:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With custom enterprise software, an organization can add and deploy only the required features and build the enterprise system centered around the internal business environment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A custom enterprise software’s biggest advantage I feel is in terms of security. </span><b>Every popular off-the-shelf enterprise software is used by hundreds of companies. So if a security vulnerability is exploited on one installation, it could potentially put all enterprise systems using the software at risk! </b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A custom enterprise software could be as unique as it gets, gives the enterprise a solid security foundation while keeping it secure from contagious security attacks as they happen with off-the-shelf software.</span></p>
<p><b>The main drawbacks of custom enterprise systems come in the form of the costs involved in software development, as well as the time it takes to build, test and deploy the final product.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether you choose to work with an off-the-shelf application or a custom enterprise software, there is one challenge in development that requires support outside the IT realm.</span></p>

<h2><strong>4. Synchronization between Operational Units and IT</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13263" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-4.png" alt="" width="496" height="512" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-4.png 496w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-4-291x300.png 291w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FileMaker’s </span><a href="https://fmdl.filemaker.com/MISC/docs/resources/2018-stateofthecustomapps/2018-stateofthecustomapps-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State of the Custom App report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests findings that 46% of businesses are looking forward to integrate other systems with their enterprise software</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In research conducted by Harvard Business Review in 2014, it was discovered that </span><b>the major challenge preventing businesses from </b><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/500075/worldwide-top-challenges-getting-enterprise-applications-to-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><b>pushing for innovative enterprise software</b></a><b> was a lack of integration/partnership between operational units and the IT Department</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The other major challenges faced by enterprises were related to the lack of skilled IT Resources and project budget constraints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One point I have stressed upon from the start of this article is the need for enterprise software to be integrated across all functions of the business. Well, that starts with the task of maintaining harmony among the IT and operational units.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Successful enterprise software is one that seamlessly integrates all functions of an enterprise into a single medium of access. </span><b>No business would prefer working with multiple software each for covering different functions such as Recruitment, Accounting, Payroll, among others</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is another case where a CIO faces a challenge between choosing an off-the-shelf or custom enterprise software. </span><b>An off-the-shelf application can never have the potential of completely seamless integration as is possible through a custom one.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take an example here. Say, an ATS application used by an enterprise tracks recruitment data perfectly. It provides information about potential job candidates, helps in screening resumes, and lets an HR in om important information about future employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if this ATS isn’t integrated with the main <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/hr-management-portal/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=hrm_13256&amp;utm_campaign=sme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">HRM software</a>, then all data about the prospective job candidates would have to be re-written into another software! A seamlessly integrated custom enterprise software saves an HR executive from this hassle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a similar pattern, enterprise systems can bring a whole new level of efficiency and productivity when perfectly integrated with both IT and non-IT functions of an organization.</span></p>
<h2><strong>5. Setting the right Priorities</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the greatest challenges in enterprise software development comes well before the start of a project. Setting the right priorities for enterprise software goes a long way in determining the potential of the end product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where the role of a CIO and other IT leaders becomes so crucial. Technically, it is the CIO’s role to manage the whole cycle of enterprise software development. However, </span><b>who he/she reports to can have a huge role to play in how the project takes shape.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the IT leader or the CIO reports to the CFO, the priorities might lie in reducing costs, enhancing the financial output or ROI out of the project, etc. </span><b>If the CIO reports directly to the CEO, the priorities might be of a much broader scope, which is necessary considering how an enterprise software affects an organization’s functioning.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider this analogy: the Enterprise software is a movie. The CIO is the producer of this movie, and the one whom he reports to is the director and holds the responsibility to direct this project towards an objective. </span></p>
<p><b>The higher the position of the reporting manager of the CIO, the greater the chances are of it being wider in terms of scope and implementation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the reporting manager has a specific position in the company, say as I mentioned in the above example about a CFO- then chances are that the project would be headed towards fulfilling an objective fit for the overseer&#8217;s functional role. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13264 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-5.jpg" alt="Enterprise software" width="512" height="359" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-5.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/stat-5-300x210.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/cio-insider-business-insights/trends-in-cio-reporting-structure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte Insights survey of over 500 CIOs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018, it was found that 46 percent of enterprise CIOs report to the highest levels of their company (CEO). This is an upward trend when compared with data two years prior. In 2017, only 45 percent of CIOs reported directly to the CEO, whereas the percentage was even low at 41 percent in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the data at hand suggests an increasing trend of CIOs reporting to the highest levels of authority, this should be moving closer to becoming a norm in 2020 as enterprise software development is more significant in value than ever before.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Answers to some general questions about Enterprise Software Development</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. What are the examples of Enterprise Software?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise systems are mainly classified into three different types of software applications:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/sap-erp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Enterprise Resources Planning Systems</a> (ERP)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise Planning Systems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer Relationship Management Software</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Enterprise Resources Planning Systems (ERP)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERP software refers to software applications that help manage all the core activities of an enterprise. ERP software is essential for the integration of multiple functions of a business and makes processes seamless and efficient. </span><b>All types of Payroll Software, HR Management Software, Inventory management software, Accounting Software, etc., come in this category.</b></p>
<p><b>Enterprise Planning Systems </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise planning systems differ from ERP software in the sense that they help in building strategic plans with data of both internal and external business environments. </span><b>Examples of Enterprise Planning Systems software are Business Intelligence tools, Project management software and Performance measurement/evaluation software available in the market.</b></p>
<p><b>Customer Relationship Management Software (CRM)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the other two types of enterprise software, CRM software deals with the management of customers of an enterprise. This is why it does not involve the aspects of integration with the business environment, and does not affect the functioning of an enterprise in a direct way as the other two.</span><b> CRM software includes applications used to take feedback from customers, keep track of customer data, analyze and use the same for their retention, among other customer-oriented use cases.</b></p>
<h3><strong>2. Should I outsource Enterprise Software Development to another firm, or should I get it done in-house?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TL;DR: <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=home_13256&amp;utm_campaign=sme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Outsourcing software development</a> is the best option if your core business isn’t associated with the technology sector. Developing software in-house is best if you already have a skilled workforce or human capital capable of handling such a project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you’re in for a verbose answer, here goes:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 11 years of my career as a Technology expert and Consultant, I have worked on both in-house and outsourcing software development projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From that experience, I can tell you what you’re getting into in both these cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you opt to start with an in-house enterprise software development project, there would be a huge load of things to look over as an IT leader.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will need to hire skilled developers and Project managers to work through the entire project.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An investment in hardware resources to develop the software will be necessary. These won’t be huge problems if your enterprise is already into the High Tech industry but would be incredibly worrisome for a company not associated with the IT industry in any way.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since you’re creating an entirely new in-house team for the project, there will be no clear way to define or analyze the cumulative experience of your team in handling the problems at hand.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the positive side, you will have more control over an in-house team and can regulate the pace of the project as necessary.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication with teams will be effortless with an in-house development team.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, outsourcing your project too comes with its own share of pros and cons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best thing about outsourcing software development is that your project will be at the hands of people who know their job well. A software development firm’s experience plays a huge role in maintaining a smooth project workflow. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An enterprise wouldn’t have to waste its time hiring new people and investing in hardware resources.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, communication with the remote development teams will be a tough affair. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When outsourcing software development, you get to choose the type of developers you want for your team. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all business leaders are supposed to be fully aware of the details about new, existing and emerging technologies. Outsourcing a software project lets you coordinate with experienced project managers who can fill any knowledge gaps, thereby saving your project from potential roadblocks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re budget conscious, then an in-house project could perhaps save some of your expenses in software development at the cost of taking away the business’ focus from its core expertise. Outsourcing, while being costlier also lets your enterprise focus on its core expertise while letting a software development firm take the workload of the project.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. How do you think Enterprise Software will evolve?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, data and emerging technologies such as AI and IoT are taking center stage as the drivers of innovation. Businesses and governments are now understanding the need to collect data, analyze and leverage it for meaningful purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it is already highlighted in the Forrester Global tech purchases report of years 2016-2021 that I shared above, enterprises are investing huge amounts of monetary resources to understand the modern technologies. They’re trying to find use cases that create change and bring efficiency in tasks where we never thought of an alternative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe the evolution of enterprise software will be led by data and the pursuit of getting the data right. Data is the crucial component to some of the most important technologies we’re surrounded by today. It is the fuel that drives the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you ask me for the ideal path where you would want to take your enterprise software- my advice would be to make it as data-oriented as possible. As far as finding opportunities for business or profitability is concerned, my bet would always be on data-oriented approaches to find the right solutions 99 times out of 100!</span></p>

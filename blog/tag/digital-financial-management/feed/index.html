<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Understanding FinOps principles is essential to implement this into the businesses:</b></span></p>
<p><b>1. Collaboration and Shared Responsibility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage collaboration between finance and operations teams. Shared responsibility ensures that financial considerations are seamlessly integrated into the operational workflow.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Real-time Visibility and Transparency: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinOps emphasizes real-time visibility into cloud spending. Transparency ensures financial decisions are based on accurate, up-to-date information, fostering informed decision-making.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Continuous Optimization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FinOps is centered around continuous optimization of costs. Regular assessments and adjustments ensure that financial strategies align with organizational needs.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Proactive Cost Management: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The principles of FinOps go beyond reactive approaches to financial challenges. By being proactive, businesses can identify and address potential issues before they escalate, ensuring cost-effectiveness.</span></p>
<p><b>5. Financial Accountability Aligned with Organizational Goals: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">FinOps ensures financial decisions align with broader organizational objectives.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From fostering collaboration and transparency to continuous optimization and alignment with organizational goals, FinOps principles empower businesses to face financial challenges and to thrive in an environment of efficiency and strategic foresight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Here’s how FinOps combines financial accountability with cloud technology: </b></span></p>
<p><b></b><b>1. Aligning Objectives:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">FinOps bridges the gap by aligning the objectives of finance and operations teams, ensuring a shared vision. By fostering collaboration, FinOps encourages joint decision-making, promoting financial prudence in tandem with operational goals.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Real-time Insights:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/digital-financial-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">digital financial management</a></strong> by embracing digital tools; FinOps provides real-time insights into financial metrics.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital transformation has become one of the most popular business buzzwords as organizations realize the importance of digital technologies in changing how they operate and interact with customers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It’s been there for over<strong> 25 years</strong> but only in recent times has it gained such popularity. Both <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Gartner &amp; Forreste</strong><strong>r</strong> have placed Digital Transformation as one of their top <strong>10 strategic trends</strong> for <strong>2023–24</strong>, respectively.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is simply because digital transformation is revolutionizing how organizations think about business. Instead of just looking at technology or IT departments, organizations are now thinking about how technology can change entire businesses from top to bottom.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This includes processes, revenue models, customer engagement, and more. Organizations that don’t adapt will be left behind by competitors who embrace digital transformation.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So what exactly is Digital Transformation? What does it mean? How can I get started with my strategy? What’s in store for us in 2022 and beyond? Let’s find out!</p>

<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let’s find out!</span></p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p">Digital Transformation: Must-have For Your Business Growth</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Today’s business landscape is changing drastically, faster than ever before. Businesses must evolve simultaneously to keep up with the digital revolution taking place or risk getting left behind and even going out of business.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">But, What exactly does this mean?</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Essentially, digital transformation means building and creating new strategies around digital channels — online, mobile apps, etc. — to generate leads or revenue for your company.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Think of digital transformation as a corporate or business-wide strategy that deals with allocating more time/money to growing your digital channel presence so you can be more accessible to customers while they’re online.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Digital transformation doesn’t necessarily mean changing your product offerings; instead, think of it as an entirely new way of marketing to customers online.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">For example,</strong> if you sell sunglasses, digital transformation could look like developing an app that allows users to take photos of themselves in different outfits. After this, you will determine which pair of sunglasses goes best with their outfit (or even buy them directly from your app).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Digital transformation requires companies to develop new skill sets in areas like data analytics and artificial intelligence to tailor their products better based on customer behavior. It also requires companies to change their entire digital strategy by rethinking everything from website design to social media engagement.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p">What If You Are A Startup</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">As a startup, the first step in digital transformation is to take a serious look at your current business model. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">What are your products and services? What do they cost? Who buys them? How do people purchase those goods and services today? Are there ways that could be simplified or automated?</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The goal of digital transformation is to take what you have now and repurpose it for an audience looking for something better, faster, more secure, or cheaper.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>To achieve these goals, companies must identify three elements within their operations:</strong></p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Weaknesses that software/technology/systems can fix.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Strengths that will allow them to capitalize on new opportunities.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Competitors who stand in their way.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Once you’ve identified these factors, it’s time to start planning. Start with low-hanging fruit (improvements that require little investment) before moving on to bigger initiatives (which may require outside help).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It’s also important to remember that not all digital transformations are equal — some focus on functionality while others focus on revenue generation.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Whatever your end game, make sure everyone involved understands how their work fits into the bigger picture so everyone is working toward a common goal.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p">Who Needs Digital Transformation?</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">A business’s goals for digital transformation will be unique to that business. Every organization that wants to remain competitive and agile in today’s constantly evolving business environment is going digital.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In a nutshell, it’s about responding more quickly than your competitors to changing customer needs by offering new products and services digitally — whether that’s through mobile apps or websites.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It also requires businesses to be open to taking advantage of emerging technologies (like cloud computing) that allow for quick change and automation.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The new goal is operating at speed while maintaining quality. Digital transformation also implies a willingness on behalf of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services?utm_source=Soft_Pro_Dev_Service&amp;utm_medium=Know_All_Dig_Trans_Stret&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_24818" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">software product development companies</strong></a> to incorporate new ideas or people who can help them adapt in a way they may not have been able to continue doing otherwise — and a decreased reliance on older ways of doing things.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>There are many key players involved in digital organizational transformation. Here are some of the most important:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Senior leadership: </strong>This group provides the overall direction for the transformation and sets the tone for the entire organization. They also have the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the transformation is successful.</li>
<li class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Transformation team: </strong>This team is responsible for leading the transformation effort and ensuring it stays on track. They work closely with senior leadership to ensure that the transformation meets its objectives.</li>
<li class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">IT: </strong>This group plays a critical role in digital transformations, as they are responsible for implementing and managing the technology that will power the new digital organization.</li>
<li class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Business units: </strong>The business units are the groups within the organization that will be most affected by the transformation. They need to be closely involved in the process to ensure that their needs are met and that they can take advantage of the new digital capabilities.</li>
<li class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Employees: </strong>Employees will also be impacted by the digital transformation, both in terms of how they do their jobs and how the organization functions. It is important to involve them to ensure a smooth transition and get buy-in for the new digital organization.</li>

<h2 class="graf graf--p">What Are The Top Digital Transformation Challenges?</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">With digital transformation becoming increasingly necessary for businesses, it’s important to be aware of the challenges you may face. By understanding and preparing for these challenges, you can increase your chances of success in making the digital shift.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">People-centric issues:</strong> One of the biggest challenges in digital transformation is getting people on board. Change can be difficult for everyone, and employees may resist new technologies or working methods. Organizations need to ensure that their employees are trained and comfortable using new digital tools and processes.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Structural problems: </strong>Another challenge businesses face organizational structure. Many organizations are designed around traditional silos, making it difficult to implement digital transformations effectively. Businesses need to create more flexible structures that allow for collaboration and innovation to overcome this.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Technical barriers:</strong> Many digital transformations fail due to technical problems. Organizations need to ensure that their systems and processes are compatible with new digital technologies. They also need to have the right infrastructure to support digital tools and processes.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Selection of wrong tools:</strong> There are plenty of online tools for digital transformation. Some, like Slack, Salesforce, or Dropbox, are specifically designed. Others can be used even if you’re not explicitly trying to integrate them into your enterprise system.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In either case, it’s important to understand how these tools work in tandem with other business processes before implementing them.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Indefinite business goals:</strong> Before implementing any digital technology, you must know your business goals. Are you trying to increase sales? Reduce costs? Reach new customers? Determine these objectives before setting up a digital transformation project. Without these objectives in place, you won’t know whether or not a transformation is even worthwhile.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Establishing a Digital Hub:</strong> If you want your digital transformation efforts to succeed, it’s essential to create a space for collaboration — and it needs to be open enough that everyone can share insights from across your business.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">While there are many software platforms on which you can do so, consider creating a digital hub with technologies such as social media, email marketing software, project management tools, video conferencing, and employee scheduling.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Finding New Opportunities: </strong>No business can stay competitive in today’s world without continuously improving its offerings and responding to changes in consumers’ needs.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Businesses are constantly seeking ways of giving customers what they want when they want it — and businesses face a wide range of potential challenges along that journey.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Get Ahead of the Curve: Tips for Developing a Successful Digital Transformation Strategy</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Here are some tried-and-true tips for developing a successful digital transformation strategy — even if you’re new to the game. Let’s look at six key steps you can follow to ensure your strategy gets off on the right foot from Day 1.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>1. Define your goals</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Before developing a successful digital transformation strategy, you need to know what you want to achieve. What are your goals and objectives? What does success look like for your business? Be as specific as possible when defining your goals, as this will help you create a more targeted and effective strategy.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>2. Conduct a digital audit</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Part of developing a successful digital transformation strategy understands where your business currently stands regarding its use of technology. This means conducting a digital audit to assess your current infrastructure, processes, and systems. Identify any gaps or areas for improvement to focus your efforts on the right areas.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>3. Engage stakeholders</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Engaging stakeholders is another important step in developing a successful digital transformation strategy. It would be best if you got buy-in from key decision-makers within your organization so that they support and invest in your initiative. Furthermore, engaging stakeholders early on will help ensure that your strategy considers their needs and concerns.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>4. Create a roadmap</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Once you’ve defined your goals, conducted a digital audit, and engaged stakeholders, it’s time to start a roadmap for your digital transformation journey. This roadmap should outline the steps you need to take to achieve your goals and timelines and budget considerations. Having a clear roadmap will help keep you on track and ensure that everyone involved is aware of the plan.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>5. Implement and iterate</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">After you’ve created your roadmap, it’s time to start implementing your digital transformation strategy. This will likely be a gradual and ongoing process, so don’t expect everything to change overnight. Instead, focus on taking small steps and continually iterating based on feedback and results. Remember that a successful digital transformation is a journey, not a destination.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">While digital transformation strategies have been growing in popularity, many businesses aren’t sure what they are or how to use them to help their business grow. By adopting the latest digital transformation strategies, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and better meet the needs of their customers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are many digital transformation strategies that businesses can adopt to improve their growth and competitiveness. Some of the latest digital transformation strategies include:</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">Adopting Cloud-based Technologies</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Cloud-based technologies are one of the most important drivers of digital transformation. They enable businesses to be more agile, scalable, and efficient. By adopting cloud-based technologies, businesses can reduce their IT costs, improve flexibility, and accelerate their innovation.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">Invest in User Experience</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">As user expectations change, businesses must rethink their strategies. The days of offering one product or service and hoping customers use it are long gone — it’s a buyers’ market, so you have to keep giving them more or risk losing them to your competitors.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">To stay ahead of rivals, prioritize users with new<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/digital-transformation-services?utm_source=Dig_Trans_Ser&amp;utm_medium=Know_All_Dig_Trans_Stret&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_24818" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">digital transformation consulting services</strong></a> and offerings that reflect evolving customer preferences. Without a better digital experience, your business won’t stand a chance against bigger players.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">Use Data Analytics to Determine Which Programs Are Working</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Make data-driven decisions by working with your marketing team to evaluate whether a particular program produces desired results. This will help ensure that you and your marketing team stay focused on efforts that are producing results and saving time and money. Ultimately, you’ll be able to use data to determine which digital transformation strategies are working best, then double down on those efforts.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">Follow Through with Online Reviews</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Online reviews have become an important factor in customer satisfaction and brand reputation. Follow up on these online reviews with a handwritten note that thanks customers for their feedback and underscores your commitment to providing excellent service. Addressing customers by name (and including it in your note) is a great way to make them feel special. Thanking them helps ensure they’ll continue to support your business by word of mouth — and even by submitting more online reviews.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">Partner With Other Brands to Offer New Products/Services</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">To stay competitive, it’s important to keep up with industry trends. One way to do that is by striking out on your own and offering products or services you don’t already offer, but another option is partnering with another company. By teaming up with another brand, you can provide customers with something new and exciting.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">Post Pictures and Videos on Instagram</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Posting videos or pictures of your product/service on Instagram is a great way to increase visibility and capture more leads. If you’re posting online content that includes photos or videos, then using Instagram as part of your strategy will be a simple transition since it uses similar tools. But even if you’re not creating visual content, Instagram could be right for you.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">Nurture Communities On Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you have a Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube account, ask your social media followers what they like about your business and what they wish was different. You can then use their insights to inform your strategy moving forward. Since your customers are really what drive customer satisfaction and even customer referrals, it’s important to stay in touch with them.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">Start Podcasting</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Podcasts provide an immersive listening experience and offer great opportunities to connect with your customers. While it’s possible to churn out a show on your own, you might want to consider hiring someone to host and create new episodes of your podcast. You can also spread out hosting duties by regularly recording episodes yourself or inviting other hosts to your show.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p">What Are The Benefits Of Digital Transformation?</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Digital transformation is an attractive option for businesses looking to stay competitive in today’s digital world. By improving efficiencies and communication, reducing costs, and increasing revenues, digital transformation can help businesses in several ways.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Additionally, digital transformation can improve the overall customer experience. These factors make digital transformation an essential tool for businesses looking to stay ahead of the curve.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Increased efficiency and communication</strong>: Digital transformation can help businesses streamline their processes and communications, making them more efficient overall. Additionally, digital tools can help employees collaborate more effectively, further improving efficiency.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Reduced costs</strong>: One of the main goals of digital transformation is to reduce costs. By automating processes and using digital tools, businesses can save money on labor, overhead, and other expenses.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Increased revenues</strong>: In addition to reducing costs, digital transformation can also help businesses increase their revenues. By tapping into new markets and understanding their customers better, businesses can boost their sales and grow their profits.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Improved customer experience</strong>: Digital transformation can improve the overall customer experience. By providing customers with personalized experiences and more convenient communication channels, businesses can make a lasting impression and build customer loyalty.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Increased employee satisfaction</strong>: Employees are happier, more fulfilled, and motivated in their roles when they feel empowered by technology. For example, remote access to company systems and programs lets employees work from home if they prefer a quieter or more flexible working environment.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Expanding global reach</strong>: As customers increasingly turn to digital platforms, consumers have more choices than ever before. Providing superior customer service across a wide variety of channels is essential for businesses that want to expand their reach, build brand loyalty and win new customers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Enhancing customer loyalty</strong>: Going digital allows businesses to deliver a consistently seamless experience across all touchpoints. An omnichannel approach has produced a 15 percent increase in customer loyalty, while an integrated strategy offers up an extra 18 percent.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Companies that master multi-channel experiences have found that they can generate 50 percent more profit per year than those that don’t.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Embracing Technology</strong>: Companies that don’t embrace technological advances risk being left behind in a fast-paced, increasingly competitive marketplace. While digital transformation may seem like an ambiguous term, it simply means using new technologies to build up your business and gain a competitive edge — and you can do it without disrupting your daily operations.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Future of Digital Transformation: Embracing Change in the Digital Age</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">The future of digital transformation is far from set in stone, and experts have different opinions on what that future holds. Some people believe that the internet of things will make life easier, while others believe we will see an increase in cyberattacks as systems become more interconnected.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The future of digital transformation will certainly be interesting to watch. Still, it’s up to you to determine what that future looks like by ensuring your business stays at the forefront of technology and digital trends.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Three scenarios in which we might see change</p>
<ul>
<li class="graf graf--p">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">Internet of Things (IoT)</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">Augmented Reality (AR) / Virtual Reality (VR)</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">With how fast information can travel nowadays and how easily it can be shared, technological advances are happening quicker. Just think about how different your daily routine would be without access to smartphones, social media, or online banking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">Digital transformation has become a critical need for businesses due to reasons’ like improving customers loyalty, driving sales, and gaining meaningful insights. All of these aspects motivate companies to embrace digital transformation strategies and invest in modern technologies.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In the current world, the importance of digital transformation can’t be understated. It’s time to take it from a concept and make it real in your company by investing in new technologies or processes that will better serve customers’ needs, which are what will help attract them even more so than before because you’re providing an experience they need instead just giving away something for free as many companies do nowadays!</p>

<p class="graf graf--p"><em><strong>Are you wondering why I should embrace digital transformation?</strong> </em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><em><strong>Actually, there are so many reasons compelling businesses to embrace digital transformation.</strong></em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For any company looking to make the leap into a digital economy, one of its key components must be customer service. And when it comes down to making customers feel understood and appreciated for who they are as individuals with needs that go beyond what can be solved by software or hardware alone? It’s not only important but absolutely necessary in order to achieve total success.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A successful business thrives on happy clients — which means understanding them better than anyone else does right off the bat because you’re going up against competitors just like yourself vying over those sweet spots where people spend most freely (and often).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">From all of this, it is clear that digital transformation is very critical for businesses in this age to thrive and continue making business. That’s the reason digital transformation consulting is highly sought-after. Among all of this, AI is expanding its reach and providing various incredible solutions for different applications.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ways AI Can Impact Digital Transformation Strategies’ Success For Organizations</strong></span></h2>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">1. Better Understanding Into Customer’s Preference</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">AI is helping to more precisely define customers’ preferences and needs, leading them into a deep understanding of who they are. This allows organizations that succeed with digital transformation projects from the beginning have better customer loyalty rates as well as improved satisfied clients based on having an accurate persona-based marketing strategy in place at launch time.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">AI helps companies get closer than ever before by looking beyond surface-level similarities between people while also analyzing potential problems or barriers before it’s too late!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Digital transformation consultant</strong> tells that by using artificial intelligence tools like IBM Cognitive Business Analytics, which uses big data analysis techniques including machine learning algorithms, among others, organizations can make sure there won’t be any bumps along with your strive to embrace it.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">2. Predict Customer Behaviour &amp; Trends</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The use of AI-based algorithms is making it possible to create propensity models by persona, and they are invaluable for predicting which customers will act on a bundling or pricing offer.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">By definition, a propensity model relies on predictive analytics, including machine learning, that predicts the probability an individual has in purchasing certain products based on their previous actions with other companies’ marketing campaigns leading them towards conversion rates such as conversions upsell/cross-sell, etc.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Propensity models have proven themselves very effective at increasing customer retention while reducing churn percentages because not only does all this help you retain your current clientele but also potentially attract new ones through better targeting techniques via characterizing each person’s personality type so there can be more relevant communication.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">3. Data-Driven Marketing Insights</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">AI has made it possible for businesses and marketers alike to take advantage of data-driven marketing tactics. Data-driven strategies are becoming the forefront in identifying your customers’ needs as well as predicting their future behaviour with greater accuracy than ever before, all without human intervention!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">When a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">digital transformation company</strong> uses AI to bring in more data-driven insight, it ensures that it brings the most optimal &amp; accurate insight. The power behind artificial intelligence also enables companies like Facebook &amp; YouTube who rely on ads to provide better targeting options which lead us into an era where cost efficiency can be observed across key tasks such as media buying or even customer service responses. It all happened just because of AI.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">A new technology called AI can be used by producers to increase their sales. The use of machine learning allows for the analysis and presentation on why consumers are not buying certain products, as well as what they might need in order make up these purchases more easily accessible through an innovative design that caters specifically towards them with lower costs associated due to efficiency gains from decreased waste production.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">4. More Consolidated Security</strong></h3>
<p>AI is revolutionizing how organizations digitally transform their security strategies. This is because the threats to customers’ identities and personal data continue to proliferate. It’s rare you hear any digital transformation strategy prioritize securing people over Programs or Processes (PIPs).</p>
<p>However, the exception maybe with the BMC ADE framework, which recognizes just how integral it can potentially become in order to attain that positive customer experience — one thing they want more than anything else!</p>
<p>The reason for this change comes down not only from an increased need among businesses these days. Instead, it is because of the individuals who are already so wary after many high-profile hacking scandals. It is where consumers had sensitive information leaked online without even knowing about them beforehand except through other means such as articles.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">5. Seamless Customer Service</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The future of customer service is AI-powered. Gartner reports that companies who embed artificial intelligence into their engagement centres will experience a 25% increase in operational efficiency while also revolutionizing how care is provided for customers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A perfect use case gave the lack or limited data available on current contexts via digital transformations strategies within eCommerce sites or brick-and-mortar stores where people can be served remotely if the need arises; this information would make all aspects more insightful and better tailored towards individual needs.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-10-digital-transformation-companies-you-must-consult-to-adapt-modern-tech/?utm_source=Top_Digi_Trans&amp;utm_medium=Digi_Tran_Str&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_22890" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Digital transformation companies in India</strong></a> are testing the capabilities of AI for customer services in different industries by implementing customer interest tracking and chatbot.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">6. Better Decision Making</strong></h3>
<p>For many businesses, the process of making decisions is difficult. With so much data available and no time left in their day for sifting through all this valuable information. So, it becomes hard to know what should be done next with your company. In fact, there are other things you wish could get back onto the track like marketing efforts or sales goals that haven’t yet been.</p>
<p>It is reached by way of prioritization discussions among employees at headquarters (or wherever). When using artificial intelligence as an innovative toolkit within these types of decision-making processes. It will not only let managers find themselves more confident about future prospects due. Besides, a deft <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">digital transformation consultant</strong> can help you curate better ways to employ it for organizational decision-making.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">7. Tracking &amp; Traceability</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The power of artificial intelligence is amazing. It can be used to identify patterns in large scopes data, helping organizations improve where needed with minimal time investment and providing insights about an organization that might otherwise go unnoticed or unheeded by those involved.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The benefits being derived from AI-powered systems are numerous: identifying inefficient processes while also saving money on unnecessary costs; gaining visibility into entities who have been previously difficult for managers to oversee due to their geographical dispersion across the globe (no matter how small); Improving decision-making abilities through automation which reduces human error rates significantly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Owing to that, most supply chain companies embrace <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/digital-transformation-services?utm_source=Digi_Trans&amp;utm_medium=Digi_Tran_Str&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_22890" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">digital transformation consulting</strong></a> to leverage AI to improve their workflow.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">8. Empowering People</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">There is a strong fear that the rise of AI might be humanity’s end. But it couldn’t be much further from reality. Though still an emerging technology with limitations and vulnerabilities in its programming. And, it needs to improve for humans as well as other machines alike.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Artificial intelligence could potentially make our lives easier by making things more efficient or personalized at times depending on what tasks need doing — including those involving Digital Transformations such as ones where we’ll see faster processes achieved through automation, saving time &amp; money while empowering people along the way too.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So ultimately, both sides benefit. Humans get their jobs done better than ever before.  Thanks largely due-in part because there will no longer have been any human effort required. And AIso who now have greater autonomy over how they do.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Evergreen IT infrastructure and integration is the new standard. This is because organizations capitalize on insights gained from AI to better scale customer experiences. Flexible, quickly adapting systems are needed for every aspect of a company’s supply chain: supplier onboarding; quality management (in case something goes wrong); strategic sourcing — getting an edge over competitors because you know what they need before it does!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This means updating your ERP or purchasing platform with features like voice recognition software. Hence, employees don’t have to take orders orally anymore-and maybe even use facial recognition at some point too.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">10. Cost Reduction &amp; Higher Productivity</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">AI is making a significant impact on the manufacturing industry.  It is reducing up to 20% of the conversion costs. New research from BCG suggests that producers will get more productivity. This will also help to generate additional sales.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is because they can develop innovative AI products tailored for specific customer needs in shorter lead times. These products are based on the process automation concept that uses computer vision algorithms or related technologies like machine learning.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Wrapping Up</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Keeping customers, employees and partners informed about digital transformation initiatives is a good way to earn trust. In these uncertain times, transparency matters more than ever before. Hence, organizations should be transparent with their communication plan when creating any new framework or strategy. It will help them to fit well alongside COVID-19 pandemic response frameworks.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The Modeling Framework is an excellent example of maintaining vendor relationships during public health emergencies. If you want to leverage AI to carve a mind-blowing digital marketing strategy, you should adapt for digital transformation services. However, you need to ensure to connect with a digital transformation company deft in employing artificial intelligence in different scenarios.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the use of online payment is increasing rapidly, and every online platform gives you a choice of paying online through various platforms, it makes things easier for the users to pay securely and fast.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1228757/online-banking-users-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the use of online and mobile banking is estimated to increase steadily between 2020 and 2024, with the Asian market being the largest. As of 2020, more than 1.9 billion individuals globally actively used online banking services, with that the number estimate to reach 2.5 billion by 2024.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Let&#8217;s discuss further how ValueCoders developed a world-class online payment banking app:</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the top </span>banking software development company<b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">our main priority was to give the desired app to the client and include as many customizations as the client need in order to build a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/wealth-management-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">financial wealth app</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, many banking software companies have started making applications that can help you with an easy transaction, we @ValueCoders provide the same benefit with more secure options, and users can buy the SENs (Complementary currency), and they will be able to use them for day to day transactions within their cities.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Technologies we used while developing an App</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Node.JS</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">React Native</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Node.JS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Node.JS is a well-known open-source, cross-platform, backend JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Node.JS can be used for building Banking Software Application that requires real-time data calculations and stats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it was our primary choice for this </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/industries/banking-financial-services#utm_source=Ang_n12&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_id=21527bankingappcasestudy" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>Banking software application</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because if more than 1 million people are using the app simultaneously, Node. JS can easily handle that, as it is a good choice for large-scale apps relying on real-time data.</span></p>
<p><b>React Native:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">React Native is also an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. Many big industries use this tool for building applications, and because it is very efficient and perfect for mobile apps, We use it for giving a better experience to the users. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Challenges Faced While Creating Online Payment Banking App</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The client wanted to make an app with solid malware, as it is a matter of transaction of money; it has to be taken care of. And the online banking apps consisted of many variables. There was some functionality of currency changes within the master admin panel, where the admin could change the currency value per SEN.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this led to the change in calculations within the application after getting it done. And the analysis was very complex, and our project management team understood the queries/calculations and tackled them by closely coordinating the results with the client. </span></p>
<p><b>The application involves currency and payment transactions, so it was necessary to keep it as fully secure as possible. We used AWS EC2 Server with SSL Layer and Amazon S3 Server for Images to meet security demand. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has always been quite fun to deal with such kinds of situations. We are a group of talented professionals and developers who know how to tackle different aspects and problems while developing an app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome some challenges, The team of ValueCoders used some </span>Banking Software Solutions<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and focused on developing the application with all the latest updates. </span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED BY US</b></span></h2>
<p><b>Requirement Analysis</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this particular segment, we try to gather every possible information from stakeholders and document the same. It helps us remember all the key factors and helps develop the app with all functionalities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We follow the &#8220;SMART&#8221; rule for creating the documentation, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And after finalizing the document, the wireframes are created, which acts as a blueprint defining the feel of the platform with respect to all functionalities. Having proper documentation of what you need and achieving the target is always necessary for better results. We always have documentation to present directly to the client to understand the project better. </span></p>
<p><b>Designing Phase</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing an app is like climbing a stair; you will face another challenge with one step up until you reach your destination. Similarly, after creating a wireframe, we move to the designing phase, in which our UX/UI developers design every single module and theme color. Every module is interlinked with functionality having some dummy data in use.</span></p>
<p><b>Execution Phase</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the designing part, our Backend developers develop all the initials API, and frontend developers integrate all available APIs with best practices making dynamic to all the screens. </span></p>
<p><b>Client Request Based Project Delivery</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving the best product to our client is our main motive, and just because of that, we constantly get in touch with the client after passing even a single module so that the client can check that and suggest anything more required. In this case also, while developing a </span>banking software application<span style="font-weight: 400;">, we connected with the client after passing every phase.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers are connected in conversations with clients daily and follow their ideas or suggestions. In case of any feasibility challenge, developers give the alternative solution and try clients to be on the same phase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clients also mention the Jira and assign the task to developers as per their priority. This process helps us meet the client&#8217;s expectations in the best possible manner and ensure the timely delivery of the tasks.</span></p>
<p><b>Deployment Phase</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all of that, in the deployment phase, we do the testing and see if the App is ready to use or not, and doing proper unit testing on a local machine merge with develop branch and deploying to the dev server helps us to know more about App. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any issues are found, the developer&#8217;s team tries to find them out and resolve them before delivering the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we send PR (pull request) for the main branch that will be deployed on the live server after review. We are using AWS servers for all kinds of deployment.</span></p>

<p class="speakable-paragraph"><span style="color: #993300;">“What the internet did for communications, blockchain will do for trusted transactions.”</span>&#8211; Ginni Rometty, CEO of IBM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That being said, Blockchain is not a mystery anymore to modern businesses. It is going to be a 20 Billion Market by 2024 and on an average, enterprises are investing $1 million in Blockchain projects. Furthermore, 69% of banks are experimenting with this technology and the number is growing rapidly. Hence, this is clear that Blockchain is the next big thing for the financial sector.  Now as a business owner, it is important for you to know how to manage your transactions better and why you should invest on Blockchain development.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we are going to discuss how Blockchain development is taking financial management to a whole new level. Let&#8217;s start with some stats and facts:</p>
<p>Bitcoin, a money exchange system, pioneered blockchain technology was first introduced in 2009. Today, it has more than 8 million accounts. From March 2015 to Feb 2017 the fees has gone up to 1289%. Moreover, Cryptocurrency has the potential to reduce bank infrastructure investment by 30%. As of now, Bitcoin has 29910 stars on Github and it is expected to do more in future.</p>
<p>Now that you know a few key things, let&#8217;s see how Blockchain development can be helpful for financial management.</p>
<h3>1) Simplified Cross-Border Payments:<span style="color: #ffffff;"> Blockchain development</span></h3>
<p>The transfer of money and virtual assets has always been an expensive and slow process. This is particularly true for cross-border payments. Blockchain technology is able to speed up and simplify this process as well as reduces the costs significantly.  With the help of advanced eWallets, now it is much easier to transact overseas.<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/crossborder-payment-blockchain-266759-3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8291 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/crossborder-payment-blockchain-266759-3.jpg" alt="crossborder-payment-blockchain-266759-3" width="553" height="369" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/crossborder-payment-blockchain-266759-3.jpg 553w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/crossborder-payment-blockchain-266759-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /></a></p>
<h3>2) Fraud &amp; Cyber Crime Reduction: <span style="color: #ffffff;">Blockchain in BankingBlockchain development</span></h3>
<p>Blockchain has potential to reduce fraud in the financial world. It is getting a lot of attention as <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/publications/assets/pwc-gecs-2014-threats-to-the-financial-services-sector.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"> 45% of financial intermediaries</a> suffer from fraud and cybercrime every year. Most of the banking systems around the globe are built on a centralized database. It makes them more vulnerable to cyber attack because once hackers breach the database they have full access. On the other hand, blockchain is a distributed ledger where each block contains a timestamp and holds batches of individual transactions with a link to a previous block. This technology would eliminate some of the current crimes being perpetuated online today against our financial institutions.</p>

<h3>3) Less Reliance On Cash: <span style="color: #ffffff;">B lockchain Programming</span></h3>
<p>Digitization of financial sector helps in cost reduction at large. Widespread use of blockchain technology, together with updates to compliance regulations, will enable central banks to substitute their own regulated, blockchain-based digital currencies for notes and coins. Some central banks, such as the Bank of England and the central bank of Norway, are already discussing discontinuing use of notes and coins entirely.</p>

<h3>4) Easy KYC (Know Your Customer):<span style="color: #ffffff;">kcha</span></h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2016/may/thomson-reuters-2016-know-your-customer-surveys.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Thomson Reuters Survey</a> Financial institutions spend $60 million to $500 million per year to keep up with Know your Customer (KYC) and customer due diligence regulations every year. With the advancements of blockchain development, there will be no need of KYC investments. Blockchain would allow the independent verification of one client by one company to be accessed by other company so the KYC process wouldn’t have to start over again.</p>

</a></p>
<h3>5) Easier &amp; Cost Effective Payments:<span style="color: #ffffff;">ckchain in Banking</span></h3>
<p>Blockchain is remarkable in improving the payments process. It would enable higher security and lower costs for banks to process payment between organizations and their clients and even between banks themselves. In the current reality, there are a lot of intermediaries in the payment processing system, but blockchain would eliminate the need for a lot of them.</p>

<h3>6) Seamless Identity Management:</h3>
<p>With <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-blockchain-developers?utm_source=blog_a24&amp;utm_medium=blockchain-8282&amp;utm_campaign=SME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Blockchain development</a>, a major change has been done in Identity management. Users can choose how to identify themselves and who will be informed. They still need to register their identity on the blockchain somehow, but after that, they can re-use that identification for other services. This changes done with blockchain development are quite great as user identity is safe inside a digital network and creates a seamless access.</p>

<h3>7) Remove Intermediates With Smart Contracts:</h3>
<p>Smart contract is a special algorithm that automates of contracts like deal making processes. Such a contract allows users to sell realities, exchange shares, money, documents or any proprietary. One of the important features of smart contract implementation is that you won’t need to use intermediary services such as brokers, notaries, agents etc to make a transaction.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8287 size-large" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smart-contracts-1024x819.png" alt="smart contracts Blockchain development" width="640" height="512" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smart-contracts-1024x819.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smart-contracts-600x480.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smart-contracts-300x240.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smart-contracts-768x614.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smart-contracts-960x768.png 960w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smart-contracts.png 1772w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>

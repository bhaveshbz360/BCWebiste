										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the use of online payment is increasing rapidly, and every online platform gives you a choice of paying online through various platforms, it makes things easier for the users to pay securely and fast.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1228757/online-banking-users-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the use of online and mobile banking is estimated to increase steadily between 2020 and 2024, with the Asian market being the largest. As of 2020, more than 1.9 billion individuals globally actively used online banking services, with that the number estimate to reach 2.5 billion by 2024.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the emergence of various online selling and purchasing platform, there has been a rise of different unique online payment modules like PayPal or Stripe. We can see a number of businesses and organizations are deploying these online payment modules, and one of the prestigious clients asked ValueCoders to develop a world-class online payment banking app. The motive of this app is to build an online payment module that can allow users to do the transaction from anywhere to everywhere. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Let&#8217;s discuss further how ValueCoders developed a world-class online payment banking app:</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the top </span>banking software development company<b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">our main priority was to give the desired app to the client and include as many customizations as the client need in order to build a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/wealth-management-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">financial wealth app</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, many banking software companies have started making applications that can help you with an easy transaction, we @ValueCoders provide the same benefit with more secure options, and users can buy the SENs (Complementary currency), and they will be able to use them for day to day transactions within their cities.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Technologies we used while developing an App</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Node.JS</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">React Native</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Node.JS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Node.JS is a well-known open-source, cross-platform, backend JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Node.JS can be used for building Banking Software Application that requires real-time data calculations and stats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it was our primary choice for this </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/industries/banking-financial-services#utm_source=Ang_n12&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_id=21527bankingappcasestudy" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>Banking software application</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because if more than 1 million people are using the app simultaneously, Node. JS can easily handle that, as it is a good choice for large-scale apps relying on real-time data.</span></p>
<p><b>React Native:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">React Native is also an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. Many big industries use this tool for building applications, and because it is very efficient and perfect for mobile apps, We use it for giving a better experience to the users. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Challenges Faced While Creating Online Payment Banking App</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The client wanted to make an app with solid malware, as it is a matter of transaction of money; it has to be taken care of. And the online banking apps consisted of many variables. There was some functionality of currency changes within the master admin panel, where the admin could change the currency value per SEN.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this led to the change in calculations within the application after getting it done. And the analysis was very complex, and our project management team understood the queries/calculations and tackled them by closely coordinating the results with the client. </span></p>
<p><b>The application involves currency and payment transactions, so it was necessary to keep it as fully secure as possible. We used AWS EC2 Server with SSL Layer and Amazon S3 Server for Images to meet security demand. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has always been quite fun to deal with such kinds of situations. We are a group of talented professionals and developers who know how to tackle different aspects and problems while developing an app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome some challenges, The team of ValueCoders used some </span>Banking Software Solutions<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and focused on developing the application with all the latest updates. </span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED BY US</b></span></h2>
<p><b>Requirement Analysis</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this particular segment, we try to gather every possible information from stakeholders and document the same. It helps us remember all the key factors and helps develop the app with all functionalities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We follow the &#8220;SMART&#8221; rule for creating the documentation, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And after finalizing the document, the wireframes are created, which acts as a blueprint defining the feel of the platform with respect to all functionalities. Having proper documentation of what you need and achieving the target is always necessary for better results. We always have documentation to present directly to the client to understand the project better. </span></p>
<p><b>Designing Phase</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing an app is like climbing a stair; you will face another challenge with one step up until you reach your destination. Similarly, after creating a wireframe, we move to the designing phase, in which our UX/UI developers design every single module and theme color. Every module is interlinked with functionality having some dummy data in use.</span></p>
<p><b>Execution Phase</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the designing part, our Backend developers develop all the initials API, and frontend developers integrate all available APIs with best practices making dynamic to all the screens. </span></p>
<p><b>Client Request Based Project Delivery</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving the best product to our client is our main motive, and just because of that, we constantly get in touch with the client after passing even a single module so that the client can check that and suggest anything more required. In this case also, while developing a </span>banking software application<span style="font-weight: 400;">, we connected with the client after passing every phase.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers are connected in conversations with clients daily and follow their ideas or suggestions. In case of any feasibility challenge, developers give the alternative solution and try clients to be on the same phase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clients also mention the Jira and assign the task to developers as per their priority. This process helps us meet the client&#8217;s expectations in the best possible manner and ensure the timely delivery of the tasks.</span></p>
<p><b>Deployment Phase</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all of that, in the deployment phase, we do the testing and see if the App is ready to use or not, and doing proper unit testing on a local machine merge with develop branch and deploying to the dev server helps us to know more about App. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any issues are found, the developer&#8217;s team tries to find them out and resolve them before delivering the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we send PR (pull request) for the main branch that will be deployed on the live server after review. We are using AWS servers for all kinds of deployment.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8572" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_198608201.eps_.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="390" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_198608201.eps_.jpg 690w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_198608201.eps_-600x339.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_198608201.eps_-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, even if you have invested many nights and days to build a mobile application people are still not bound to use your app if that does not encourage them. They will have no excitement with the app if it does not help them in monetary terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very crucial for you to check the likes and dislikes of your mobile app status on Google or the app store. You will be required to perform deep research to build an app that motivates users and sets off their interests in a better way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A key step in mobile app development is gathering feedback about your idea from real users. Talking to customers and testing apps early will give you a much better sense of whether people want what you’re planning to build—and help you figure out how to make it better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have an idea for an application, there are many ways that you can test it with potential users before investing too much time and money into building something no one wants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re building an app for multiple platforms, conduct user research. The way people use their phones and tablets differs widely—and so do their preferences for apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, mobile web users are more likely than native app users to visit retail sites like Amazon or eBay; in contrast, mobile game players favor apps over mobile web pages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, your customer personas will likely look different depending on designing a website or a mobile application. You may even want to consider forming separate personas for other devices!</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"> 2) Right platforms and features:<span style="color: #ffffff;"> Mobile App Development Tips</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are clear with your users’ likes and dislikes, you need to decide on your app features and platform. The aesthetics and appearance of the application work differently on different platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, you will need to study the target platform, functions, and specific parameters to make the application appropriate.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to content and user interface, choosing the right technical features, such as integrating the <a href="https://messente.com/blog/best-sms-gateway" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">best SMS gateway</a> for apps requiring robust messaging functionalities, is crucial for a great user experience. If it does not have some basic features to make it useful to the user, it will be quickly uninstalled from the phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, you need to develop applications that are simple yet functional. However, there are many ways you can add extra features like social media integration or push notifications, which can also increase your revenue potential.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mobile app development company should provide valuable insights on which platform would work best for your business needs and suggest practical ways to create a compelling app that users will love using.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need expert Mobile app developers for all these things, as developing an app requires extensive knowledge about design patterns for different platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, you also need help in determining what type of information should go into your mobile app so that it becomes successful among your target audience.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3 ) Offline Friendliness: <span style="color: #ffffff;">Mobile App Development Tips</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8567" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline.jpg" alt="Youtubeoffline" width="1368" height="912" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline.jpg 1368w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline-960x640.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1368px) 100vw, 1368px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, it is a new trend in the development of mobile applications that is getting the attention of both companies and developers. It is the way an app behaves when there is no Internet connection available.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more patrons turn to their smartphones and tablets for entertainment, news, social networking, and information about local businesses, your app must work well without an internet connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going offline means you can still offer a top-notch experience to users who don&#8217;t have cell service or are in remote areas with no coverage at all. Make sure to include local information on your app to find nearby places or things of interest-based on where they are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try using geolocation features that automatically detect users&#8217; locations to see what&#8217;s around them even when there&#8217;s no internet connection. It&#8217;s one big thing that makes applications successful these days.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4) Make simple apps just like a smartphone</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smartphones are a sensation. From a toddler to an old person, everyone can use it. This makes its target audience even bigger. Just like a smartphone, your app has to be simple. It will not only expand your reach but also users will keep coming back.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to build an app for your start-up or new business, it can be tempting to try and create something overly complex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s possible to create a hit game or social media platform, it’s more likely that you’ll end up with a mediocre product that nobody wants. Instead of reinventing the wheel and making something too complicated, focus on making simple apps instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For example, if you run a small retail store in New York City, consider creating an app that allows customers to check out their favorite products while they shop in your store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may not seem like much of a big deal at first glance, but by making things easier for people who already like what you have to offer—and by providing them some kind of incentive—you could see significant results in no time at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as it’s easy to use and gives users something of value, you can be sure there will be plenty of interest.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5) Ads &amp; Banners: Keep it limited</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8568" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant.jpg" alt="ads-relevant" width="1050" height="657" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant.jpg 1050w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant-600x375.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant-768x481.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant-960x601.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make it a successful custom mobile app development project, you need to avoid the overuse of ads and banners. A consumer can delete it anytime if he finds it is bothering his browsing experience. This is a very broad hint and not just a friendly tip! If your user finds the mobile screen too cluttered, they will certainly uninstall your app,</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So keep in mind that an ad banner should be limited to only one or two per page.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, try as much as possible to keep them on both sides of each corner so that users do not have problems with navigation while using the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another point worth noting here is to make sure that you choose advertisement services carefully because there are several ways through which developers can add ads and banners to their apps. The most popular ones include Admob, Mobclix, Adsense, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must understand how each of these ad networks works before deciding on a particular one for your application. The primary purpose of advertising services is to help mobile app development companies earn money from advertisements, so they need to ensure maximum visibility of ads on mobile screens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means more traffic for them and more irritation for users who do not want any disturbance while using their phones or tablets. So it’s up to you if you want maximum revenue or user satisfaction!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s your choice!</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">6) Customized Design:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two leading mobile operating systems in the market i.e. Android and iOS. Both users have access in different ways. Ensure that your application complies with each operating system policy and fulfill their terms and conditions. You can also go for custom mobile app designs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile apps are meant for smartphones, but they are also designed to support tablets, and mobile operating systems are also specially designed to cater to users with widescreen displays. Your application should be compatible with both Android and iOS devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you need to ensure that your app is properly optimized for each platform. A good application will get a good rating in both stores, i.e., Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want your mobile app to get successful? You need a good combination of graphics, design elements as well as functionalities that can attract more users towards it so that they can download it on their device without any hesitation or cost involved in it.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">7) Grid-based applications:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accept the grid design to ensure maximum consistency even when users move from page to page in the entire application. Experts will always adopt draft concepts based on grids in mobile application development projects.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be done by ensuring every element is fixed width and height and is aligned at every corner of a cell. It makes it simpler for </span>mobile app developers<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create applications that have uniform elements and avoid any kind of cluttering on each screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grid-based applications are more scalable as they allow users to resize elements without affecting other parts of an app&#8217;s interface. For example, if you want the application to appear larger on a tablet, you can simply increase its dimensions without affecting its content or layout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why </span><b>mobile app developers </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and designers usually prefer grid-based designs over fluid layouts with a fixed width and height but aren&#8217;t aligned at every corner.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing for mobile devices is easier for many people than designing for desktop computers because it forces them to focus on only one screen size. This makes it easier for them to create good apps across all devices rather than making multiple versions for different screen sizes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile apps also tend to be more accessible when compared with desktop apps because their interfaces don&#8217;t require scrolling or zooming to navigate from one page to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, they use buttons and tabs that make navigation easy even when using touchscreens, requiring users to interact with their screens using only their fingers instead of mouse pointers or keyboards.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To get to the top of the millions of applications in the online market, your app needs something more than ordinary to get noticed and downloaded.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to stand out from other apps, it is important to make sure that you have an app description written by professional writers who can write it so well that they can convince users why they should download their app instead of another similar one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where SEO comes into play and optimizing keywords to ensure your app ranks higher on searches related to those keywords.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">9) M-marketing is Gaining Traction</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, it is trending to market via apps. In the peak season, your product will need to go public/live. Develop and launch the app a little before that and script out the marketing strategies. Align them together for best results. Ensure to make use of optimization searches.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile marketing is becoming a high priority for companies of all sizes. Because smartphones and tablets allow for direct contact with consumers at any time, businesses can take full advantage of mobile marketing to make their sales funnel more efficient and boost their bottom line. Mobile applications are particularly effective in closing deals with customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, app users are three times more likely to purchase a mobile app than a desktop or laptop computer or tablet. Moreover, mobile devices have become extremely accurate data collection tools, allowing businesses to gain insight into customer behavior and drive sales accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart marketers understand that if they want success for their start-up company, they need to look beyond traditional advertising options and explore new tools that can make their business grow exponentially over time.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">10) One App For One Reason</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep your app focused only on a single problem. Any app needs to solve a single problem only and do that in an expert manner. Don’t make an app that can unzip files and become a torch and then let you excess to GPS and so on. This type of app never succeeds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An app with two or more functions is never as successful. Focus on solving one specific problem and have a successful app. Research your competitors&#8217; apps, take out their best features and make them better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that your app has its unique selling point to attract people to use it, but don’t make anything too complicated for users to understand. Keep it simple!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple app makes better design sense, but also simplicity helps your app from being complex or full of bugs, which means users are likely to stay there longer.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">11) Choose the right people</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Successful mobile application development depends fully on the developers. You should always emphasize hiring only veteran<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-ios-developers?utm_source=blog_amyra_rg121&amp;utm_medium=ios_8561&amp;utm_campaign=SME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> iOS</a> or <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-android-developers?utm_source=blog_amyra_rg121&amp;utm_medium=android_8561&amp;utm_campaign=SME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Android developers</a> who have specialized in at least one specific technology. It is better to hire Android developers with experience in producing high-quality mobile apps than look for someone who has a vague mixture of knowledge across several technologies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for iOS developers, as they need to be well versed with Objective C and Swift programming languages. If you are looking forward to creating an app that serves your business needs perfectly, you must find people who can deliver what you want within your time frame and budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to look for mobile app development experts is by conducting thorough research on various professional websites such as Clutch or Upwork. You should also take advantage of social media platforms like LinkedIn or Twitter, where you can follow professionals from different companies and industries and access their work experience details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, try reaching out to them via phone calls or emails before deciding whether or not to hire them based on their previous work experience, portfolio details, hourly rates, etc.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Bonus tips</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">12) Check out for new OS Updates</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be it Android or iOS, updates are important. A major update sometimes changes the entire landscape and if your app cannot meet the requirements, it would be a big issue. If you stay up-to-date, you can also help prevent the issues listed on the platform with the latest releases. Take a look at the improvements notes that capture the potential issues that will damage your success.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Apple recently released iOS 9.3, which includes support for Wi-Fi calling and new emojis. The company says that users should upgrade their devices to run all apps smoothly, but that is not always possible. Some apps may not function well until developers update them to support newer versions of iOS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But keep in mind that there are apps that may need to be updated before working with an upgraded OS version. This is because developers have to ensure that their apps run smoothly on older OS versions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you&#8217;re using an older device that runs an older version of iOS, you&#8217;ll need to wait for these app updates before upgrading your OS version to 9.3. Otherwise, some of your favorite apps might stop working once you do so!</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">13) Test properly</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8566" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/android_app_testing_specifics-01.png" alt="successful mobile app development" width="710" height="416" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/android_app_testing_specifics-01.png 710w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/android_app_testing_specifics-01-600x352.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/android_app_testing_specifics-01-300x176.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After all your efforts and long working hours if you do not test your app on every platform it would not be a success. While physical devices are used, you do have the option of testing on simulators for mobile devices.  Ironing out the bugs by running your app through a variety of device simulators helps you save time. It makes your app a success by improving the user experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing is also one of those areas where many entrepreneurs can cut corners to save money. You need to make sure that everything works as intended before going live. It means thoroughly testing your product or service with real users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re planning on releasing an app for iOS devices, then there are a few things that you should know. The first thing is that Apple has specific guidelines and rules regarding how apps are built, designed, and tested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to follow these rules will result in rejection from Apple’s App Store and potentially damage your reputation as an entrepreneur who cares about quality over quantity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should avoid testing on jailbroken devices if your business plans to charge for app downloads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jailbreaking installs apps from sources other than Apple’s official App Store. It causes problems with payment processing later down the line. If possible, test on non-jailbroken devices only!</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching a new app can be exciting for entrepreneurs and clients alike. Unfortunately, a lot more work goes into it than meets the eye. Creating something that people want takes plenty of hard work and endless hours, and launching your app is only one part of it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ve got an idea, and it&#8217;s time to build it into an app that will wow your customers. The first &amp; foremost question you might ask yourself is, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What android libraries should I use to help me make this?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here are tons of</span><b> high-performing libraries </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">out there, &amp; you could spend days researching them all.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Before you do that, though, stop and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">think about your needs. </strong>Do you have special needs? Or are you just looking for something generic? Your answers to these questions will help shape how you approach choosing a library.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If speed is essential, don’t go with a slow library that does everything under the sun just because it’s got every feature in existence — and if something goes wrong down the line, be prepared to work with what’s already in place instead of dropping everything and looking for alternatives.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Check out these Essential Android Libraries &amp; Start Planning your Next Android App Today!</span></strong></em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>Let’s discuss them in detail.</strong></p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">1. Dagger 2- Simplifying Dependency Injection</span></strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-30996 " title="image19" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image19.jpg" alt="image19" width="996" height="498" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image19.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image19-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Dependency injection is a process whereby one object provides another object with its services. It’s often used in software development to make code more maintainable and testable. Luckily, Google released an open-source library called Dagger 2 that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">makes dependency injection easier </strong>for Android developers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Even if you’re not using Dagger 2 for your project, it can be helpful to understand how to implement dependency injection manually. That way, you can benefit even if your organization isn’t ready to adopt a third-party library.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">As long as you have a firm hold of dependency injection in general, it shouldn’t be too hard to implement it in your app.</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Injecting dependencies makes your code more testable by removing hard-coded dependencies. In general, injection helps make your classes less tightly coupled, making them easier to maintain and more straightforward to unit test.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It also improves modularity because you can swap out implementations without modifying classes that use them.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Additionally, a dependency-injected service is easy to unit test in isolation since it gets provided with a mocked implementation during testing.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It saves you from worrying about where a particular object came from when being used in place of another thing since all references get captured in one place.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It can significantly reduce confusion when coming back to old code or determining why something isn’t working when debugging your app or testing it under various conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cons:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">It can be challenging to understand and utilize. Also, since dependency injection has many different features, there is a learning curve for understanding its intricacies.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">While performance won’t suffer with it, if your app’s dependencies are large or numerous, you might find them hurting performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">2. Retrofit- Smoothens HTTP Communication</span></strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-31001 aligncenter" title="image23" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image23.jpg" alt="image23" width="976" height="488" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image23.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image23-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is among the top Android libraries that </span><b>simplifies HTTP communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and enables your app to consume RESTful web services.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Retrofit can be an excellent tool to get the job done if you&#8217;re looking to take advantage of backend APIs.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Its idea was to make it easier for developers to send HTTP requests and parse responses without dealing with low-level networking code.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is also an excellent choice when connecting an Android app to a backend on services. For example, Facebook or Twitter then Retrofit is undoubtedly the right option for you.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Retrofit is an HTTP client library for Android.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It uses annotation processing for generating boilerplate code for dealing with making requests, parsing responses, etc.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">You can focus on your networking implementation instead of writing that code yourself. For example, Retrofit can handle parsing request parameters into your Java objects automatically.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It allows you to put your implementation code in an interface or abstract class without worrying about making network requests at all.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cons:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">It does not support Android’s Otto design pattern.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">There are also some performance issues in many cases when Retrofit parses JSON responses coming from APIs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">3. EventBus- Middleman between Multiple Classes</span></strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-31000 aligncenter" title="image22" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image22.jpg" alt="image22" width="982" height="491" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image22.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image22-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" /></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">EventBus, also known as GreenRobot EventBus, is an Android library with the primary objective of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">delivering events between different application components.</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, activities, fragments, services, etc., according to the EventBus GitHub page. EventBus can save you time &amp; energy by acting as the middleman between multiple classes in your app.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, it may not be the perfect library for all projects. Depending on your needs, there are several ways to use EventBus effectively — or not so effectively — and let’s explore them.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">EventBus makes it easy to decouple different components of your application.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Different event handlers don’t need to worry about each other — instead, they just need to know how to respond to a given type of event.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">They also don’t need any shared context or data structure to give them information about their siblings or cause problems if misused.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being among the top android libraries it ensures fewer potential errors. </span></li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It helps your application become more modular, helping you develop it faster and with fewer issues later on down the line.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cons:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">The biggest problem with using EventBus is that it has an asynchronous nature. It means that when you register to listen for events in your Android Application, your application will become unresponsive. It will continue until an event arrives.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">If you are running in a foreground service or your app is in full-screen mode on a device with notifications enabled, Android will display a persistent message. It will keep on asking if you would like to receive alerts when new events occur.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">4. Picasso- Ranks among the Best Android Libraries for Image Downloading</span></strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-31002 aligncenter" title="image24" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image24.jpg" alt="image24" width="976" height="488" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image24.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image24-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /></p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Picasso automatically changes image names for us whenever an API provider updates them.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It makes downloading and using images from the internet more accessible.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Picasso simplifies tasks such as adding an image to the UI, loading it from the internet, etc.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It trims the load time of the app.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cons:</strong></span></h3>

<p class="graf graf--p">RxJava is a Java VM implementation of Reactive Extensions. It is a library for <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">composing asynchronous &amp; event-based programs </strong>by leveraging observable sequences. It means that developers can convert GUI events like button clicks, model changes, or timer notifications to data streams, which applies to other observables.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">These observables can also push data to other subscribers over time, so it’s easy to create interactive, event-driven apps using RxJava. For example, you can use one observable sequence as your model, with its values emitted as new events in your app.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Meanwhile, another talk changes whenever those values change — allowing for reactions such as recalculating things based on those values automatically.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">It takes a functional approach to use streams of data.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Instead of setting up complicated logic in an onClick() method, you can define that logic once and then add it to all of your click events (or use cases) with a single line.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">You can also easily extend its functionality by creating custom operators.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It provides a consistent way to handle asynchronous operations across Android, iOS, &amp; the web. Thus, if you need to switch frameworks for one project, you’ll be able to pick up where you left off in another environment.</li>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Let&#8217;s move further and know the benefits of using Ionic in cross-platform mobile application development…  </span></strong></p>
<h2><b>Why Enterprises Prefer Ionic Framework For Mobile App Development?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting from experienced Ionic app developers to normal businessmen, each of them nowadays favors employing Ionic SDK for agile and leading development of mobile applications. Moreover, you can also avail</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of</span> Ionic app development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make effective use of all features. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19194" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/affsa.png" alt="Ionic features" width="1024" height="555" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/affsa.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/affsa-300x163.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/affsa-768x416.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">Image Source: Agile Infoways</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here I have stated the few pointers which help you know why businesses should choose an Ionic framework for mobile application development.   </span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Open Source SDK</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To develop an excellent hybrid app, Ionic is one of the most appropriate choices for startups and SMEs as it is a 100% free, open-source framework authorized under MIT. It completely works differently and amazingly in the context of abrupt breakdown that other open-source SDK come across. With this open-source framework, you can perform things extraordinarily as it is steady, robust, and reliable. Ionic App Development is a savior if you are looking for agile app development. </span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Development Of Mobile Apps Across Platform</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Ionic, you can create hybrid mobile apps that can work over various mobile devices with different operating systems (OS). But while developing the mobile applications in Ionic, keep in mind that the app should be consistent with the different operating systems as this will only help you make use of this special feature of Ionic.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Single Code-base</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ionic allows you to form high-end user interfaces utilizing the same code to develop applications for different platforms. The programming languages that the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-10-hybrid-apps-created-using-ionic-framework-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Ionic framework</a> applies are simply and quickly transformed from one operating system (OS) to another, which enables the app to be adopted across varying platforms.                        </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one chooses a native language instead of a hybrid, more efforts and money would be needed to learn selective languages for each platform. This can also shake the startup &amp; SME&#8217;s total mobile app development cost budget. </span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Default UI/UX</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good UI/UX design is the main component of each mobile application. Ionic includes wonderful animations with appealing themes and designs. This framework is considered one of the top-rated Front-end frameworks (UI interaction) containing various components such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript (JS), and beautiful designs. Moreover, this platform helps businesses in forming attractive and user-friendly applications.</span></p>
<h3><strong>5. Completely Based On AngularJS </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ionic-based mobile apps are powered up by AngularJS. By prolonging the HTML Syntax, AngularJS grants outstanding structure to help enterprises make codes more docile. In order to develop high-performing browser-based applications, the framework employs AngularJS. Moreover, AngularJS with Ionic helps you more by offering a bunch of functionalities.</span></p>
<h3><strong>6. App Integration </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ionic offers high-end application integration that enables the sharing of data and processes among various business apps. Moreover, it supports enterprises to organize their operations and correlate features with cloud apps. Most people encounter difficulty in the app integration part; if you are also facing the same, </span>hire ionic developers<span style="font-weight: 400;">. This will help you make the Ionic app development process smooth.</span></p>
<h3><strong>7. Easy Testing Of Apps</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing is one of the crucial phases as this helps you analyze the working process of the mobile application. With an Ionic framework, the testing process became very easy. Using this framework, one can test the application on a desktop and as well on a browser performing simulator testing employing Cordova commands for iOS and Android apps. Additionally, you can also test the apps by remote debugging.    </span></p>
<h3><strong>8. Utilization Of Cordova Plugins</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know what plugins are? It is a small piece of code, in JavaScript (JS) format, appended to your app that allows you to perform numerous tasks like a native app. Cordova plugins are available in the Ionic, which ultimately grants access to multiple operating system features (OS) such as pro-location, access to logs, camera, and more. These plugins intensify the complete performance of the mobile apps, and for doing so, you just need to add up a few simple codes to your development. </span></p>
<h3><strong>9. Robust CLI (Command-Line-Interface)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comprehensive command-line interface is an in-built development server employed in the Ionic framework. It is a text-based interface where a user utilizes the command prompt to interact with the mobile application through the support of multiple commands.   </span></p>
<h3><strong>10. Useful Native Plugins</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ionic framework has complete access to native APIs &amp; Plugins that grant apps a native user experience. With Ionic, you can utilize around 120 native devices functionalities such as Bluetooth, Fingerprint AUTH,  and a lot with Cordova plugins. These plugins offe0r you access to multiple functionalities and help you enhance the overall performance of an app. </span></p>
<h3><strong>11. Scaled Up Technology</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ionic utilizes web-based technology, which mainly helps you doing app future updation. It means whenever you require to make modifications to your code or need to customize any adopted component that can be made simply without putting any effort.</span></p>
<h3><strong>12. Huge And Helpful Community</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not a simple task to work out with a new framework. Sometimes it&#8217;s become challenging even for experienced Ionic developers. Ionic is one of the most popular frameworks like Cordova and Angular; it has a big and active community. So working with Ionic can be simple as if you will be having any sort of query, then you resolve the same by taking the support of the community. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">When we talk about <span style="font-size: 14pt;">game engines</span>, there are only two major players, Unity 3D and Unreal Engine in the war of &#8220;Unity vs Unreal&#8221;. Some of the world&#8217;s most popular games such as Fortnite (Unreal Engine) and Pokémon Go (Unity 3D) are powered by these gaming engines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Both Unity 3D and Unreal gaming engines are rapidly growing along with the entire gaming market. A study by MarketWatch suggests that the gaming engine market will grow at <strong>13% CAGR</strong> over the next <strong>5 years</strong>, and reach a valuation of <strong>$3650 billion by 2024</strong>. In comparison, the current value of the gaming engine market stands at <strong>$1750 billion as of Q1 2019.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">If you are updated about the gaming world, you might already know that <strong>Unity 3D has a 48% market share </strong>whereas <strong>Unreal Engine is standing at 13%.</strong> However, this doesn&#8217;t say all. Both have their unique offerings and the final decision depends on your requirements. This brings us to the topic:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Unreal Engine vs Unity 3D Games Development: What to Choose?</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>What&#8217;s your plan? (choosing between unity vs unreal)</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Before we start discussing Unity vs Unreal, it&#8217;s important to decide what kind of game are you trying to build. Maybe you are trying to build 3D, 2D, or something that mixes both. You may want to keep your first game pretty simple but interesting like word puzzles or shooter games. It can be something that has a high requirement of revenue generation with high-quality graphics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Are you building a game for hobby purposes, or planning to launch it on app stores, making it available for online/offline purchases? You need to decide all these factors before you come up with choosing the right game engine.</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Looking to improve the existing custom software? VALUECODERS A <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=Blog_al&amp;utm_medium=unityvsunreal_6067&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">CUSTOM SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES</a> COMPANY offers <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-development?utm_source=Blog_al&amp;utm_medium=unityvsunreal_6067&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">application development services</a> from a pool of 450+ experts.</strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Once you have the plan ready, it&#8217;s time to consider a few deciding factors to choose your gaming engine &#8220;Unity VS Unreal&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Pricing (unity vs unreal)</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The first factor that comes to mind is pricing. Both the engines have some of the parts free and some chargeable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The full version of Unreal Engine 4 can be free of cost if your game revenue is less than $3,000 /quarter; if more, 5% of your game&#8217;s gross revenue will be charged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The Unity Gaming Engine has a free Personal plan which is totally free, and good enough to be used by individuals and small businesses. Unity offers two types of packages for bigger businesses. The Plus package is available for businesses with revenue less than $200K in the past 12 months before purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">This package is available on a monthly/annual subscription as per your choice. The monthly subscription for the Plus package costs $35 per month, and the annual subscription for Unity Plus is priced at $299, on a prepaid basis.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Unity offers a Pro subscription for businesses with revenue greater than $200K in the past 12 months before purchase. The Pro subscription offers few additional features such as source code access and priority customer services and support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Businesses can choose to purchase one of the three packages offered for subscription to Unity Pro. There is a 2-year prepaid package that <strong>costs $2,850</strong>,  an annual prepaid package that costs <strong>$1500</strong>, and a monthly prepaid package priced at <strong>$125 monthly</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Apart from that, there are separate charges for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/earning-gaming-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">game development</a> in iOS or Android.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Hence, you can see if you are planning something big then developing with Unity 3D can be a good choice. However, if you have a simple or experimental plan then Unreal Engine can be a saver.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Programming Languages <span style="color: #ffffff;">(</span></strong></span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; color: #ffffff;"><strong>unity vs unreal)</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">To build a highly secure and scalable game that needs less code, having the right programming language is important. Unreal Engine 4 uses C++ for coding and Unity 3D uses JavaScript or C#. Deciding which program is better is your personal preference and should be considered as per the skill sets. If you prefer any of these programming languages over the other then the decision may be quite easy for you.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Asset Stor<span style="color: #333333;">e <span style="color: #ffffff;">Unity vs Unreal</span></span><br /></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Both Unity 3D and Unreal Engine 4 have their own asset stores. There you can get ready-to-use 3D models of characters, textures, environments,  and even sounds and particle systems. However, Unity 3D clearly comes out on top because of the number of assets in its store. It has everything, from animation and GUI generators to extensions for AI control and ORK Framework for creating RPGs. Hence, with a better asset store, you can build awesome games with unity 3d.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asset-store-Unity.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6070" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asset-store-Unity.jpg" alt="Asset store Unity 3D" width="810" height="532" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asset-store-Unity.jpg 598w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Asset-store-Unity-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></a></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Platfor<span style="color: #000000;">ms Unreal Engine vs Unity 3D</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The more platform access you have, the more you increase your customer base. Let&#8217;s see which engines offer the best in terms of platform coverage:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Unreal Engine</strong>: iOS, Android, VR, Linux, Windows PC, Mac OS X, SteamOS, HTML5, Xbox One, and PS4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Unity 3D</strong>:  iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8, Tizen, Android TV, and Samsung SMART TV, as well as Xbox One &amp; 360, Windows PC, Mac OS X, Linux, Web Player, WebGL, VR(including Hololens), SteamOS, PS4, Playstation Vita, and Wii U.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">It seems <strong>Unity is the winner</strong> in this case.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Ease of use  <span style="color: #ffffff;">(Unity vs Unreal)</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Unity 3D is known for it&#8217;s easy to use interface where new developers can start making games easily. Though Unreal Engine made many improvements in the latest update like the statistical mobile upload feature, they still take second place behind Unity 3D in terms of user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Unreal-Engine-vs-Unity-3D-ease-of-use.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6071 size-large" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Unreal-Engine-vs-Unity-3D-ease-of-use-1024x400.jpg" alt="Unreal Engine vs Unity 3D ease of use" width="810" height="316" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Unreal-Engine-vs-Unity-3D-ease-of-use-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Unreal-Engine-vs-Unity-3D-ease-of-use-600x234.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Unreal-Engine-vs-Unity-3D-ease-of-use-300x117.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Unreal-Engine-vs-Unity-3D-ease-of-use-768x300.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Unreal-Engine-vs-Unity-3D-ease-of-use.jpg 1117w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Both interfaces are quite similar, with toolbars and settings within resizable &amp; movable windows. Unreal’s user interface is quite bloated and complex. It takes more time than Unity 3D in many aspects. Assets take a long time to import and save, and simple tasks require extra steps. Unity 3D is fast, and the interface is quick and responsive. It’s light and it can run on Windows XP (SP2), while UE4 needs at least Windows 7 64-bit. Though the final product can look nicer in Unreal than in Unity 3D, it can take more effort, especially for beginners. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Blueprint<span style="color: #ffffff;">  (Unity vs Unreal)</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Blueprint-unreal-engine.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6073 size-full" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Blueprint-unreal-engine.jpg" alt="Blueprint unreal engine" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Blueprint-unreal-engine.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Blueprint-unreal-engine-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Blueprint-unreal-engine-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Blueprint-unreal-engine-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Unreal Engine 4 has Blueprint visual scripting. A node-based scripting method right inside it. Technically you don&#8217;t need to write code. This is great for quickly prototyping levels, and you can even create entire games using the Blueprint. If you are not a programmer then you can build games with some limitations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">However, this facility is not available with Unity 3D and that&#8217;s a drawback.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Graphic<span style="color: #000000;">s Unreal Engine vs Unity 3D</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">When it comes to graphics, Unreal Engine 4 is way ahead of Unity 3D. From complex particle simulation systems to advanced dynamic lighting Unreal Engine has it all. Unreal Engine 4 has the capabilities to really create any kind of visual style that you want in 2D or 3D. It&#8217;s always good to be able to have the option to push the graphics further if you choose to do so. However, with the upcoming Unity 3D version 5, it is expected to be near to Unreal Engine.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong>Conclusion of  &#8220;Unity VS Unreal&#8221; </strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Both engines are amazing game creation tools, and similar in many ways.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><b>What is ReactJS?</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">JavaScript has gained huge popularity in the last decade. A lot of frameworks like Meteor, Ionic, Angular, PhoneGap, and many more are helping developers to develop complex applications. One of the most efficient, powerful, and open-source frameworks to design dynamic user-interfaces is Facebook’s ReactJS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">ReactJS came into existence in 2011 by “Jordan Walke” one of Facebook’s software engineers.

Netflix, UberEats, PayPal, InstaCart, Reddit, and a lot more are the serene examples of this particular framework.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><b>Advantages of ReactJS for Enterprise App Development</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">ReactJS is the future of UI or </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-front-end-developers?utm_source=reactjs_al&amp;utm_medium=reactjs_wblog&amp;utm_campaign=SME" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">front-end development</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>.</strong> It is an evolving framework that is getting refined day by day. You should put your investment in it! But, Why ReactJS?</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Facebook’s ReactJS comes with a lot of benefits over other frameworks. Let’s explore 10 reasons to use ReactJS for enterprise app development projects.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Efficient &amp; Intuitive Way of Web App Development</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The coding becomes easy when working with ReactJS. Instead of fiddly JavaScripts code, it allows developers to use JSX, a fusion of HTML &amp; JavaScript functionalities. This is also the core reason to choose this framework over others because this way the development time gets reduced.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">JSX, the component extension made the learning easy and implementation became a lot easier than the traditional JavaScript templating. It buys time for the developers to focus on individual components.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Using the state, action and event management of ReactJS, developers can fully control the way applications behave on the user&#8217;s actions. It is the beauty or one of the best benefits of ReactJS.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Great Way of Developing User Interface</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The UI or user interface of an application makes it attractive and it also affects the success rate of the application. For making an app user-friendly and to increase its success rate, it is required to have high-quality and functional UI.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The declarative components are one of the biggest advantages of ReactJS. It allows the developers to easily develop complex UI functions and debug them easily. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The UI developed using React has a lower loading time and the apps become smooth and responsive to operate. So that your enterprise app will offer mobile-first experiences and consumer-grade simplicity at the same time.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Save Development Time with Reusable Components</b></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13739" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/react4.png" alt="reactjs" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/react4.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/react4-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Facebook’s ReactJS offers component reusability. Developers can reuse generic components without any issue. If the components are having non-complex logic in them, it becomes easy to reuse them and also the process to maintain these components becomes easy.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">This framework let the programmers simply create a class and to use as much as instances they want. These components are totally isolated from each other and change in one component doesn’t affect others working.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the advantages of ReactJS reusability feature, the developers save development time &amp; efforts, and they can focus on creating precise &amp; optimized components for better app efficiency.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Faster Rendering using Virtual DOM</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">ReactJS uses virtual DOM for all the components and React-DOM creates required updates and rendering to the real DOM-tree on its own without any interference of the developer.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">First, the developer creates the changes to the application then all the changes get done over the virtual DOM. If all the changes &amp; modifications are risk-free and don’t affect the performance, then the React-DOM gets updated.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13740" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/react5.png" alt="react" width="512" height="216" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/react5.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/react5-300x127.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">This way the risk management takes place for all the changes in the app. All the cost for DOM management gets reduced in return and the developer gets the performance boost. It improves the overall performance of the app and the users get a quality experience.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Scalability of Apps at Ease</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the need of rich enterprise web applications, scalability of apps becomes a really important factor to consider. The front-end system of an app should be scalable so that it can handle the big number of users, changes, and datasets.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to the flexibility that React.js provides to the developers. It opens a no worry option for the developers where they can decide everything about the scalability of the project like app&#8217;s structure, it&#8217;s architecture, and by managing the pattern of JSX code, developers can also eliminate the messy or complex code situation.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">So, whenever you plan to scale your enterprise app, or want to update the app with new UI features, or think to add more components to your app, there will be no issue with the scalability. The performance of the apps remains intact even after the complex updates that is one of the great advantages of ReactJS.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Flexible with Various Platforms</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The support of different libraries and flexibility to select tools and architecture for development makes it the best choice for enterprise app development. This freedom means that the businesses can go for customization of the application by selecting the preferred tech and tools without having any platform issue.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">This is also the reason why ReactJS is the best </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-front-end-developers?utm_source=reactjs_al&amp;utm_medium=reactjs_wblog&amp;utm_campaign=SME" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><span style="font-weight: 400">front-end development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> platform and the </span><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019?utm_source=so-owned&amp;utm#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-loved2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400">most loved framework</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> when it comes to custom app development projects with quick development, best user experience, and simplicity during the process in return.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Future-Proof &amp; Backward-Compatible Applications</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the compatibility of the framework, you don’t need to change the existing code whenever there is an update on the corner. No matter what update it is going to be, all the public APIs of the framework remain the same. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Developers don’t need to replace their knowledge or concepts due to its backward compatibility. These updates also keep the framework relevant to the near future and make it future-proof.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The component reusability and single codebase for all the platforms like Android, and iOS are also the advantages of ReactJS platform that let the developers conveniently fix the errors and bugs in no time. These USPs attract many developers and enterprises towards this mature technology for futuristic apps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Integration with the Legacy Systems</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Upgrading an existing system with an improved UI can change the overall experience of a legacy system. The integration of ReactJS framework opens new horizons for the improvements in the existing UI. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Where recreating a system will cost a lot of money, time, and efforts, developers can easily integrate this UI framework into a legacy system to make it appropriate as per the business requirements.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Injecting React components in your existing web app will mix new with the old, and it will also remove the cost of outdated technology recruitment and maintenance. This is Why ReactJS is a great choice for revamping legacy projects as well.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Big Community Support</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the biggest advantages of ReactJS is the big community of developers that contribute to enhancing its documentation every day. Due to its community-driven approach, all the information and documentation of innovation is always there for everyone.</span><br style="font-weight: 400" /><br style="font-weight: 400" /> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13743" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/react6.png" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/react6.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/react6-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The community consists of millions of developers and thousands of contributors that are available on multiple forums and platforms like Stack Overflow to fix the issues. On </span><a style="font-weight: 400" href="https://github.com/facebook/react/stargazers" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400">Github</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, React has 151007 stargazers, which clearly shows the huge community support for this framework.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Elevate Productivity</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, we’ve seen multiple <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/business-benefits-of-reactjs-framework-for-modern-web-and-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">benefits of ReactJS</a>. The reason behind using this library or this convert-able framework is its efficiency and all those features or elements that it provides to make development easy.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Features like component reusability, Virtual DOM, Backward-Compatibility, and its flexibility for other platforms, allow the developers to craft applications that offer great UI with complex workings.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">If we talk about the effect of ReactJS over enterprise app productivity, then the apps developed using ReactJS offer great UI, with consumer-grade simplicity, and mobile-first experience. That’s the reason why ReactJS is the best for enterprise app development.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><b>Sum-Up</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">For getting out </span><span style="font-weight: 400">of the box solutions for your enterprise apps, it will be the best choice if you </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-reactjs-developers?utm_source=reactjs_al&amp;utm_medium=reactjs_wblog&amp;utm_campaign=SME" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">hire Reactjs developers</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>.</strong> It is the best available UI framework, that lets the developers create complex UI structures without any issue.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Facebook&#8217;s ReactJS is not a complete framework, it’s a library but after mixing it with some tools or technologies, it offers the best outcomes to the front-end developers. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Another thing that makes it the most cherished is the improvement that the community and contributors are providing to this library, and like every now and then Facebook is providing updates for this library.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Businesses can get the best possible outcomes for their custom enterprise app development projects, or they can also integrate the framework with their legacy system to make it relevant for the business requirements without recreating the whole system.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Rest, the advantages of ReactJS are listed here, that clearly shows that a business can get scalable, robust, and future-proof apps for their employees to improve productivity with very minimal efforts.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are planning to develop an enterprise application for getting better communication, ROI, and want to improve the overall work efficiency of your employees, then </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers?utm_source=reactjs_al&amp;utm_medium=reactjs_wblog&amp;utm_campaign=SME" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">hire Indian programmers</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> from ValueCoders who have experience of 15+ years, when it comes to development.</span></p>

<h2><b>Why Do Businesses Need Software Development Methodology?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be productive and successful in your business, you need to know exactly what you want to accomplish and how you plan to do it. Without clear goals and a concrete plan, it’s easy to lose focus, which results in wasted time and resources. </span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25078 size-full" title="development methodology" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/development-methodology.png" alt="development methodology" width="486" height="499" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/development-methodology.png 486w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/development-methodology-292x300.png 292w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Img src: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, software development methodologies can help you create this framework that will keep you on track throughout the project’s lifetime. Here we have elaborated on the reasons why your business needs software development methodologies:</span></p>
<h3><b>1) To Make Sure Everyone Is On The Same Page</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a team is creating software, all members must have a common understanding of how things will be done. For example, if you’re working on a project intended to process transactions as fast as possible, everyone needs to know what as fast as possible means. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure team members understand their roles and responsibilities, they should be provided with detailed requirements and objectives that outline project specifics.</span></p>
<h3><b>2) To Ensure There Are No Miscommunications</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication acts as a two-way street: as much as you want your team to understand what you want, you also need to understand what they need. To get their input, ask open-ended questions that don’t force them into yes/no answers; ask what if? Questions that leave room for multiple scenarios; and brainstorming together. Don’t be afraid to give constructive criticism, too—the best solutions are often created through an iterative process.</span></p>
<h3><b>3) To Make Sure You Deliver What You Promise To Your Customers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All too often, businesses fail to deliver what they promise to their customers. In many cases, companies don’t start with a clear roadmap of what they need to do. By developing a methodology for software development, you can create an organized and consistent approach for building your product or service.</span></p>
<h3><b>4) To Help You Avoid Costly Mistakes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software development methodologies provide a set of rules for development, which are documented and enforced. They help you create easy-to-read and test code, ensuring accuracy and consistency. They also let you work with your team members in an organized way, minimizing duplication of effort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These things can help prevent costly errors that would otherwise arise throughout software creation. You don’t want bugs to make it into production—it’s simply not good for business!</span></p>

<hr />
<h3><b>5) To Ensure You Meet Deadlines</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A deadline is a must when it comes to software development. If you don’t have set deadlines for your project, it could easily be delayed and never finished. Deadlines not only force action but also help you stay on track by giving you something to aim for and get excited about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, they provide clarity of purpose: When everyone knows what they need to accomplish within a given time frame, there’s no question about what needs to be done.</span></p>
<p><b>Example:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=webblog_development_methodology&amp;utm_medium=S05&amp;id=25073" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> software development company</a> uses an agile methodology, emphasizing fast-paced and continual innovation within each project’s time limit. Agile projects are organized in smaller timeboxes called sprints, each with a specific goal.</span></p>
<h3><b>6) To Promote Collaboration</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good methodology will encourage collaboration between different teams and individuals, improving communication and ensuring that everyone is working towards the same goal.</span></p>
<h3><b>7) To Increase Customer Satisfaction</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using a methodology that focuses on quality and efficiency, you can help to increase customer satisfaction with your software. This can lead to more repetitive business and improved brand loyalty.</span></p>

<h2><b>The Curated List Of Top Software Development Methodologies For Enterprises</b></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><b> Waterfall Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In waterfall methodologies, every step or goal needs to be met before moving on to the next part. For example &#8211; if you have five tasks that need to be completed but only three are done while one is left undone, the project can&#8217;t continue until it&#8217;s been completed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This system has several pros compared to other ones out there- for instance, it doesn&#8217;t require too much thinking and planning, which helps save time, and because it has steps laid out beforehand, there&#8217;s less room for error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main advantage of the waterfall model is its predictability. Because each stage is completed before moving on to the next, tracking progress and identifying potential problems early on is easy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main downside of the waterfall model is its inflexibility. Once a stage of the process has begun, it&#8217;s difficult to make changes without starting the whole process over again from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spiral methodology is also called waterfall because it follows a linear pattern without backtracking. Unlike its predecessor, though- it offers more flexibility in prototyping so that we can test new ideas earlier on in the process instead of making costly mistakes later on during the development stages.</span></p>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phases (generally described as Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Maintenance) are easy to understand and manage.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideal for less experienced teams and managers as confusion is minimized.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple rigid model keeps things clear and easy to test.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant amount of time is saved.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only focuses on precise needs.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does not work well for maintenance software development projects or long-term projects.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no way to know the project&#8217;s outcome in advance.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><b> Rapid App Development Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid Application Development provides an ideal way to take maximum advantage of software with minimal investment costs. This condensed model allows quick adjustments that speed up results, and you repeat user design/construction phases until project requirements finish (stages include: requirements planning; construction). </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there&#8217;s no need to go back through all four again once something has been changed in one stage.</span></em></p>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">More useful for projects with well-defined objectives and user groups.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best for small to medium, time-sensitive projects.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitates the development process by developing high-quality projects faster.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take customer feedback for improvements and specific results.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stable team with experienced developers need for this methodology to work.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requires highly skilled developers to design complex problems.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does not work for small budgets.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><b> Agile Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This methodology makes it possible to develop software by working in small increments called iterations. It helps improve efficiency because you can find problems early on and fix them before they become bigger issues later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is known as &#8220;reducing risk&#8221; or reducing uncertainty, among other things, through testing scenarios during each stage of development (user stories).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main pros of agile software development is its flexibility. Because teams can adjust their plans, agile methodology is best for projects with rapidly changing requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main disadvantage of agile software development is that it is difficult to track progress and estimate deadlines since the project&#8217;s scope may change during the development process.</span></p>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model adapts to changes quickly.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct and regular communication maintains clarity about the project and goals.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defects and differences in expectations are detected early, so they can be corrected before they become significant problems.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focusing on the details and losing sight of the &#8220;big picture&#8221; can cause the project to drift.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real-time communication requires massive engagement with users and colossal manpower investment on the part of developers.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">May not work for larger organizations (a hybrid approach with another methodology may be useful).</span></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><b> DevOps Deployment Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/cloud-services/devops-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">DevOps deployment methodology</a> is a game-changing approach that improves all aspects of project management. It has been proven to lower the time it takes for projects and software releases, reduce failure rates overall as well as help developers be more efficient with their work producing better results in less amount of downtime or wasted resources.</span></p>
<p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significantly reduces time to market.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Improves customer satisfaction and product quality.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increases productivity and efficiency of employees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">May require ongoing system updates that customers do not want.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">DevOps may not work for some industries that need testing before moving to operations.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When working with departments, some undetected problems may go unnoticed.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This methodology takes a modular approach to software development, building individual components that can reuse in different applications. It can save time and money during the development process and make it easier to maintain and update software systems.</span></p>
<h3><b> Agile development</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This iterative approach to software development is more flexible and responsive to changes, making it ideal for rapidly evolving projects. Also, agile methods can also help improve communication and collaboration between developers and other stakeholders.</span></p>
<h3><b>DevOps approach</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This methodology emphasizes collaboration between developers and operations teams. It helps in speeding up the software development process by making it more efficient and streamlined.</span></p>
<h3><b>Behavior Driven Development</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BDD aims to make it easier for businesses and developers to understand what to develop. Using a language you choose (e.g., Gherkin), BDD lets you write what your app should do before writing any code. It makes your specifications clearer, so there’s less back-and-forth between business and engineering teams later on.</span></p>

<h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3>
<p><b>What is enterprise software development?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise software development is a term that refers to the process and methodology of developing software for large businesses and organizations. This type of development typically follows a more formal and rigid set of guidelines and procedures than other types of software development, such as <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/web-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">web or mobile development</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The enterprise software development process often begins with requirements gathering, in which analysts work with stakeholders to understand the needs of the business. A team of developers will create a design based on those requirements. Once the design is approved, the actual coding and implementation of the software will begin.</span></p>
<p><b>What are the 5 software development models?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of which software development model to use is fairly important, as it will decide only the success or failure of a project. Here are five popular software development models to use:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Waterfall</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Agile</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Spiral</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Lean</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-DevOps</span></p>
<p><b>What is Agile software development methodology?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile software development is a newer methodology for developing software that focuses on speed and flexibility.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore software testing is done on different levels. Here are the key levels that offshore qa teams work on for testing a web or a mobile app.  </span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Unit Tests</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit Tests are performed by a testing resource to check if the execution of functions has been proper or not. Independent testing of functions is done to ensure that each function is tested thoroughly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, unit tests help in creating test samples that are useful in improving the quality of the test results. </span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Integration Testing </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This form of testing includes a set of features that have to be tested by dedicated testing professionals. This form of <strong>testing helps</strong> in correlating the working of individual functionalities and the complete feature. The data from unit tests helps in doing integration tests more efficiently.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Qualifying Tests </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This kind of testing goes to the next level. The testing professional uses qualifying use cases to test complete scenarios. Independent testing teams are required to do these kinds of tests so that they can create multiple scenarios and test the system appropriately.      </span></p>
<h3><b>User Acceptability Tests</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tests help in finding out the usability of the application amongst its users. This test makes sure that the application can be easily used by the users. </span></p>

<h2><b>Types of Application Testing</b></h2>
<h3><b>Application Performance Testing </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application performance testing is conducted to ensure that the software application meets the performance requirements.   This type of testing is important for any software application that will be used by a large number of users.</span></p>
<h3><b>Testing The Application Robustness </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tests are used to test the strength of the application by putting it under conditions that are below normal. It is important to understand and foolproof the recovery mechanism of the software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to run such tests to ensure that one does not have to incur huge costs on occasions of system failure. </span></p>
<h3><b>Testing the Functionality of The Application </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every software has some specifications according to which it is developed. The scenarios in which the software is written are described earlier on, and these tests are conducted on the basis of these scenarios. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to test all of the features and functions of the software. The test cases should be designed to cover all of the use cases. In addition, the tests should be executed in a variety of environments, including development, QA, and production.</span></p>
<h3><b>Testing The Scalability of the Application</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of an application depends on the number of users it can accommodate. If an application cannot sustain an increasing number of users, it will fail in the scalability test. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why it is important to ensure that the software can handle the increased load. The load test should be conducted with representative data sets and transaction mixes. In addition, the test should include both peak and average loads.</span></p>
<h3><b>Testing the Platform Compatibility</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When testing the platform compatibility, it is important to ensure that the software applications are compatible with the target operating system. The target operating system can be a different version of the same operating system or a different operating system altogether. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, it may be necessary to test the software on multiple target operating systems.</span></p>

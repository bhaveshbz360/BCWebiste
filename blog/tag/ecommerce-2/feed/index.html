<h2><b>Shopify Cons</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there are many benefits of Shopify website, like everything, it also has its limitations or disadvantages. Let’s have a look at some of the cons of Shopify:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Monthly Fees</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify offers a monthly subscription fee, which can add up over time. There are different pricing plans available, but even the basic plan can be a significant expense for small businesses.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Transaction Fees</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to monthly fees, Shopify charges transaction fees if you use payment gateways other than Shopify Payments. This can increase your overall costs, especially if you have a high volume of sales.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Limited Customization</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Shopify provides many themes and customization options, there are limits to how much you can modify the design and functionality without advanced technical skills. For more complex customizations, you might need to hire a developer.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>App Costs</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the apps that enhance your Shopify store come with additional costs. Depending on the number of apps you need, these costs can add up quickly, increasing your overall expenses.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Platform Dependency</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Shopify, your store is dependent on the platform. If Shopify experiences downtime or technical issues, your store could be affected. Additionally, if you decide to switch to another platform, migrating your store can be challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By weighing these cons against the benefits of Shopify, you can hire Shopify programmers and take an informed decision about whether Shopify is the right for your business.</span></p>

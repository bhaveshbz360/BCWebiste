<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature of Android makes it easier for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">developers, as they do not have to write different codes for different platforms. The same code can be used for all operating systems and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saves a lot of time and effort. </span></p>
<h3><strong>High ROI with Lower Costs</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Android being one of the most dominant mobile operating systems today, it has a lot of traction. It means that there are a lot of applications available for Android, making it easier for you to promote your app.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android applications are secure, and they do not get affected by viruses. The reason behind it is &#8211; Android apps are only downloaded from the Google Play Store and not from any external source.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, there is no chance of your application getting corrupted by a virus or malware. Hence, with Android app development being secure, you need not worry about its security or whether it will be hacked at some point in time. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Customization</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes Android popular is its excellent feature of being customizable. The Android operating system has been designed to be modified and changed according to users&#8217; preferences. Developers, too, have a lot of freedom while creating an app for Android, as any rules or policies do not bind them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This feature helps developers create a mobile application that fits your business model perfectly, thereby increasing its usability and popularity among the target audience and ultimately increasing your return on investment.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Best Mobile App Development Practices for Android</strong></h2>
<figure id="attachment_24418" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24418" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-24418 size-full" title="benefits of choosing right development company" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/benefits-of-choosing-right-development-company.jpg" alt="benefits of choosing right development company" width="512" height="384" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/benefits-of-choosing-right-development-company.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/benefits-of-choosing-right-development-company-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-24418" class="wp-caption-text"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Pinterest</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the best practices to ensure a successful mobile app development for Android. They will help you avoid the common pitfalls and make the process less challenging. </span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Conduct In-depth Research</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step toward developing a mobile app is to conduct in-depth research. It will help you identify your target audience and understand your needs. You can develop a mobile app that meets their requirements and expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting market research will also assist you in determining if there is a need for your proposed app. An excellent way to conduct market research is by asking people directly about their needs, what they want from your app, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If possible, try creating mockups of your proposed app and show them to people so that they can provide feedback on how useful it would be for them and what features should be included or excluded from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important thing about conducting market research is learning about similar apps already available on Google Play Store or Apple App Store.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Design Strategic Plan</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have conducted your market research, it is time to design a strategic plan. A good strategy will help you understand how your app will be different from other similar apps and help you decide what features should be included in it and what features should be excluded from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also help you determine if there is any need for an app of that kind in your target audience&#8217;s eyes. For example, if people are already using similar apps that offer similar services or products, there is no point in developing another one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, if people are not using any such apps, then it would make sense to develop one that offers something new and useful.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Choose Development Method</strong></h3>
<p>After deciding on your target audience and designing a strategic plan, it is time to select a development method. There are two main mobile app development methods – native app development and cross-platform app development.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most companies prefer native app development because it allows them to develop an app that has all of its core features on one platform. It also makes it easier for them to update their apps when required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-platform app development, on the other hand, involves developing an app on multiple platforms at once. This may be valuable if you want your users to access your services from different devices without having to download a separate version of your mobile app for each device.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Opt For The Right Technologies</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have decided upon your development method, it is time to decide on which technologies you should use. The first step in deciding on which technology to opt for is deciding whether you want your app to be available only for Android or iOS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will help you determine if you want it to be developed with native technologies or cross-platform ones. If your app is being developed for both platforms, there are two main options – either use an open-source technology like HTML5 that can run on all platforms efficiently or create it with native APIs.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3>5. Front-end And Back-end Development</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your app is being developed for both platforms, you will have to decide whether you want it to be a native app or a cross-platform one. A native app is developed with a programming language supported by a particular platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if your mobile app is being developed for iOS, it should be developed using Objective C or Swift programming languages. Similarly, if your mobile app is being developed for Android, it should be developed using Java.</span></p>
<h3>6. Mobile App Testing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your mobile app has been developed, it is time to test it. You must test your app on multiple devices and check if there are any bugs or errors. You can also conduct beta testing of your app before launching it officially.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During beta testing, you can get feedback from users about whether they like your app or not and what features they would like to see in future updates of your app. It will help you improve upon its existing features and add new ones based on user feedback.</span></p>
<h3>7. Launching The App</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your mobile application has been tested and you are satisfied with its performance, it is time to launch it. You can launch your mobile app on the Google Play Store or Apple App Store by submitting it for approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your mobile app has been approved, you can start promoting it so that more people can download and use it. You must keep updating your mobile apps regularly to remain relevant in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, remember that developing an excellent mobile application requires a lot of hard work and dedication from your side. If you have decided to create an application for a specific platform like iOS or Android, then make sure that you know all about its features before developing an application for it.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years, <strong>Asia</strong> has become one of the most favored outsourcing destinations in India. More and more businesses are preferring to work with Asian outsourcing companies for a various number of reasons. In a recent survey, <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>80% of US and European businesses have listed India as the top outsourcing destination</em></span>.</span> Therefore, some questions arise, “Why do companies outsource to India?” and “Why is India the Hub of Application Development?”.</p>
<p>Even though there are many other countries that have emerged as major competitors, however, IT outsourcing companies in India are the top ones to work with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40867" title="India is IT Hub" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB.jpeg" alt="India is IT Hub" width="1001" height="650" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB.jpeg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB-300x195.jpeg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB-1024x665.jpeg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB-768x499.jpeg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB-480x312.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></p>
<h2>Reason Why India Is The First Choice For Application Development</h2>
<p>When we started the research at our <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=Blog_al&amp;utm_medium=Indiaforappdev_3933&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">custom software development company</a>, ValueCoders to find out why do companies outsource to India and why is India the hub of application development, we found some of the following favoring reasons:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>India&#8217;s population which is over 1.3 Billion</b></h3>
<p>India is also one of the countries where many people speak English(125 million) compare with other countries in the world. Other than this, India also has the quality of talents which attracts various businesses. Annually, around 3.1 million graduates are added to the workplace.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cost-Effectiveness &amp; </b><b>Quality Services</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cost-effectiveness is one of the main advantages that software development companies in India offer. Flexibility in pricing allows businesses the freedom to manage their budgets and provide them with a huge set of benefits. This pricing factor is the main reason why there is a huge gap that exists between personnel costs in India and that of other developed countries.</p>

<p>India is a democratic country, and it has the most stable government in the world. The IT sector has always been a top priority for the Indian government.

With excellent support by the government, Indians are able to build a high-tech IT park which has the best in class technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s government does not change the rules frequently; that&#8217;s why other countries prefer India to avail of application development services. This is the only reason Why is India The Hub of Application Development.</p>

They are experts in their fields and possess in-depth knowledge and extend logics while developing various software. This is the reason why Indian developers are more technologically sound.</p>
<p>The Indian app developers have good knowledge of advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), IoT, Blockchain, Big Data, and more. Nowadays, various business verticals prefer to adopt modern technologies to develop the app, and that&#8217;s why the other countries look for technology-specific developers who build an app at an affordable rate. These all things are possible when you will hire the developers for India.</p>

<h2>How Can You Determine The Mobile App Development Cost?</h2>
<p>When it comes to mobile app development, the cost is the second most important concern of every new business owner after the UI/UX of the mobile app.</p>
<p>Hence, determining the mobile app development cost is one of the most influential factors in the success of any mobile app.</p>
<p>For this, you can&#8217;t rely on a single factor in order to determine the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=mobileapp-8796&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a> cost. There is involvement of various factors such as the choice of OS, the complexity of the project, the design and the animation which affect the overall mobile app development cost.</p>
<p>In this blog, we have discussed some of the major factors which are needed to be considered before developing any mobile app.</p>
<h3>Here is the list: <span style="color: #ffffff;">mobile app development cost</span></h3>
<h3>1) Features</h3>
<p>The incorporation of various new features and functionalities of the mobile application play a crucial role in the decision of the mobile app development cost. There is a complete set of characteristics that should be considered while determining the mobile app development cost.</p>
<p>The characteristics or features you want to embed in the mobile app are based on the target audience, the requirements of the client and the type of application you want. However, the likes of social media platforms and security features can be integrated into the application.</p>
<p>You must bear in mind that, with each additional feature, the mobile app development cost will increase accordingly. Therefore, you should be very considerate before infusing each feature into the mobile application.</p>
<h3>2) Number Of Screens<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8798 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screens.png" alt="" width="1114" height="650" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screens.png 1500w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screens-600x350.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screens-300x175.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screens-768x448.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screens-1024x597.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screens-960x560.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1114px) 100vw, 1114px" /></h3>
<p>For a creative mobile application, you can think about adding multiple screens for your mobile application. Because some applications can have several features and meet those needs, the mobile app development team has to add more screens and integrate more UI / UX.</p>
<p>In this way, the user can scroll through the application in more than one way. But this will ultimately increase the overall mobile app development cost since it includes adding more screens, the number of hours and efforts of the development team.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to make sure that the functions you want to display on the screens are relevant enough.</p>

<hr />
<h3>3) Mobile App Development Team</h3>
<p>It is one of the main factors considered by all mobile development companies that will give you the overall estimate of the mobile app development cost. Once you are ready to have a mobile application, you should look for the best mobile development company.</p>
<p>This is because a reliable mobile development company always offers the best mobile application solutions to its clients. You must analyze the mobile development companies or the mobile app development team well before giving them the contract.</p>
<p>Although most companies have internal teams of experienced and competent mobile app developers. If the mobile development company will be efficient, you can save a lot of your hard-earned money.</p>
<p>In simple words, a mobile app development team should consist of a project manager, mobile app developers who will work in the field, a UI or UX designer and a quality analyst. In case your mobile application needs API, a back-end developer will also be involved for this.</p>
<h3>4) Mobile Platform</h3>
<p>An operating system is considered as the backbone of any smart device. To develop a mobile application, you need to find the best platform on which the success rate of your application is the maximum. So the question is: How the mobile app development cost will depend greatly on the operating system you choose.</p>
<p>Some of the known operating systems are mentioned below:</p>
<p>-&gt; iOS</p>
<p>-&gt; Android</p>
<p>-&gt; Windows</p>
<p>For the same concern, the version of a particular mobile app is another significant aspect of determining the mobile app development cost.</p>
<p>Today, operating systems are used to run on the multiple versions. For instance, iOS currently supports version 9, 10, and 11 while Android OS supports Jelly Bean, KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow, and Nougat.</p>

<h3>5) Security Of The App<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8799 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seurity.png" alt="" width="1125" height="664" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seurity.png 1400w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seurity-600x354.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seurity-300x177.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seurity-768x453.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seurity-1024x604.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/seurity-960x566.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px" /></h3>
<p>In this modern mobile app development scenario, hacking and cyber attacks have become a common thing. So, the security of the application is something that must be prioritized.</p>
<p>Nowadays, users are more aware than ever and can weigh the developed mobile application in this particular perspective. As the owner of the mobile application, the responsibility of keeping the user&#8217;s data and information confidential remains with you.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to make sure you will not mess up with it because once you break the trust of the uses, it will be almost impossible to regain their confidence.</p>
<p>Also, if your mobile application supports any type of payment option, then you should be very cautious with respect to it. Hence, maintaining the security of the app ultimately adds to the mobile app development cost.</p>
<h3>6) Maintenance And Updates</h3>
<p>While determining the mobile app development cost, post-development factors are equally vital. Once you have finished with the development of the mobile application, the functionality is the next big thing.</p>
<p>You must review all your application before presenting it to the public. You will not be satisfied in just two or three dry implementations. With each test, there will be one or another thing that will arise.</p>
<p>For instance, the maintenance and updates of the mobile application. People tend to present several types of errors and deficiencies in an application.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to keep up with all the regularities. Approximately 30 percent of applications are updated monthly, while 52.8 percent of applications are updated every six months according to a report given by Network World.</p>
<h3>7) Copyright Of The Mobile App</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-16076" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/licencing-1.png" alt="" width="1112" height="544" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/licencing-1.png 1840w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/licencing-1-300x147.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/licencing-1-1024x501.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/licencing-1-768x376.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/licencing-1-1536x751.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px" /></p>
<p>The license of mobile applications and copyright are another crucial aspects that must be taken into account. However, in the end, it is your idea and it is your mobile application, so it is better that you have to take care of it.</p>
<p>In many cases, people tend to copy elements from other mobile applications. Therefore, to avoid any upcoming issue to your mobile app, it is always better to request the copyright of your application which would add a little to your overall mobile app development cost.</p>
<p>Also, before publishing your application, you must request a license for it. The license of the application ideally lets you in. To register your application on any of the app stores, you need to pay something.</p>
<p>For example, Apple charges around £69 a year and the Google Play Store charges around £20 for publishing a mobile app.</p>

<hr />
<h3>8) Hybrid Or Native App</h3>
<p>Depending upon the usability of an application, there are two types of mobile app development available i.e native mobile app development and hybrid mobile app development that determine the mobile app development cost.</p>
<p>The native mobile application is the conventional one, which provides numerous features and is best in terms of performance. In addition, it comes with better UX standards. On the other hand, a hybrid mobile application can be run on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>It takes less time and effort to develop an application. Also, it is much more cost-effective mobile app solution as compared to the native application. However, everything depends on you and your business requirements. Taking into account the pros and cons of these two applications, you can make the final choice.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Freemium</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15312" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-new.png" alt="freemium - mobile app model" width="668" height="324" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-new.png 2000w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-new-300x146.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-new-1024x497.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-new-768x372.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-new-1536x745.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" />Source: Google</p>
<p>It is one of the most favored ways of monetizing your app by offering it for free. But the users need to at least one purchase to receive all the benefits from the app.</p>
<p>While using music, antivirus, or such mobile applications, you must have noticed that several ads get opened without clicking on any button. This occurs because the apps use the uses a freemium model. The users are more likely to spend cash on an app&#8217;s premium features by offering the app for free.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The users are more likely to spend cash on an app’s premium features by offering the app for free. It helps in increasing retention rate and user engagement as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you want to make money with your app, go for the freemium model. The best example of freemium apps is Candy Crush Saga, Clash of Clans, Duolingo, etc.</span></p>

<h3><b>2. Commissioned Apps</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Business Model of mobile application development is based on revenue sharing between developers and clients. The developers make a certain percentage from each app sold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model is suitable for small business owners who do not have enough money to pay for an app development project upfront but want to earn money from their apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are many risks involved in commissioning apps as you need to find a developer that will work with you. If you don’t find one, then your app will never be developed, and you won’t be able to monetize it at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if your developer does not promote your app well or does something wrong with it during its development process, then again, there is no chance that your app will generate any income for you at all.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioned Apps is probably best suited for companies that have some experience in developing apps or companies that know someone who can develop good quality apps quickly and easily without much cost involved. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Freemium Apps That Allow Multiple Purchases</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15313" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-model-header.png" alt="freemium-model-header" width="704" height="353" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-model-header.png 1454w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-model-header-300x150.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-model-header-1024x513.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/freemium-model-header-768x385.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p>Just like the basic freemium model, a multi-purchase freemium app allows users to put more money while using the application.</p>
<p>This thing is having usually been seen in mobile games. This model instigates the users to keep spending money on their free app by offering additional game items.</p>
<p>And many of the addicted users keep pumping money into the game to advance their rankings. Making money via mobile app depends on the model means which business model you have selected for your mobile app development.</p>

<h3><b>4. Affiliate Marketing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of many app monetization models, affiliate marketing, is based on partnerships. The business agrees to pay a commission for products or services that are sold through its app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many large brands work with affiliates, and it&#8217;s a great opportunity for influencers to earn money by driving sales for some of their favorite brands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon has an expansive <a href="https://www.shopper.com/discount-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">affiliate program</a> that&#8217;s one of the best in terms of being highly lucrative and very well-regarded. Other retailers have similar programs, like eBay&#8217;s Partner Network, where you can earn commissions from a wide variety of businesses through an app they use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affiliate marketing isn&#8217;t just about making money; it&#8217;s also about building relationships. Influencers who partner with brands can help drive awareness, increase engagement and even boost loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, according to research conducted by Nielsen Catalina Solutions, consumers who engage with branded content (including influencer content) are more likely to make a purchase than those who don&#8217;t.</span></p>

<h3><b>5. </b><b>Sponsorships</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-24239 size-full" title="Sponsorship" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Sponsorship.jpg" alt="Sponsorship" width="512" height="345" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Sponsorship.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Sponsorship-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the best app monetization options available in the market. The idea is to establish a brand presence within your app by adding an advertisement and affiliate link that generates revenue when users click on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also reward them with incentives (often referred to as click-through rewards) like games, exclusive content, coupons, or access to premium features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key here is getting more users to not only download your app but actually use it. That’s why many developers choose rewards over simple advertisements that just sit there and don’t give users much incentive to interact with them (especially if they have no use for your product).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also important to make sure these types of promotions are legally compliant with all applicable laws regarding e-commerce sales. When done right, you can generate significant revenue from sponsorships alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, you should always consider what will work best for your particular audience before making any decisions about how to monetize your app.</span></p>

<h3><b>6. Premium</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Premium model (business model of mobile application) is one of the most common mobile app monetization models used by developers. It’s a simple and straightforward business model where users download your app for free and pay for premium features or services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From in-app purchases to additional content, there are several different ways you can employ a premium model to make money with your app. One of these options is to charge users outright for downloading your app, while others include offering special members-only benefits in exchange for an annual subscription fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to use a premium model (business model of mobile application) is through in-app advertising. You could allow advertisers to place ads inside your app, which you then sell ad space directly from within your app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This works especially well if you already have a large user base that is highly engaged with your application since it allows advertisers access to that audience without having to go through third-party channels such as Google AdWords or Facebook Ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, another option for using a premium model is by charging users for access to more advanced features within your application once they have downloaded it initially for free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, if you are unable to use the Business Model of mobile applications successfully, then </span>hire Mobile app developers<span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the best</span> Mobile app development company<span style="font-weight: 400;">. By doing so, you will adequately use an applied model.   </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>7. Subscriptions </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monetization strategy that best fits apps is subscriptions, with in-app purchases being a close second. Subscriptions work because they offer value to users, from saving them time or money and giving them something of use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can give content for free upfront and then offer advanced features for a monthly or yearly fee, or you can offer a version of your app with limited functionality, which after using it, users are prompted to upgrade to a paid app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you plan on using an ad-supported model, make sure that you have more than one source of income. In other words, don’t put all your eggs in one basket!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you plan on offering high-priced subscription tiers, consider offering more basic services as in-app purchases. This way, if someone doesn’t want to pay for full service but does want access to some portion of your application, they will be able to do so without paying through ads.</span></p>

<h3><b>8. Data Monetization</b></h3>
<figure id="attachment_24240" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24240" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-24240" title="Data Modeling" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Data-Modeling.jpg" alt="Data Modeling" width="512" height="342" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Data-Modeling.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Data-Modeling-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-24240" class="wp-caption-text">Image Source: Data Modeling</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps with access to some of your data can turn your information into money. This is done by selling you their services or by selling your information to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies like LinkedIn and Facebook sell their users’ information in return for a portion of ad revenue. Alternatively, a company could gather data about users’ habits and sell that information back to those same users as advice on how to act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In either case, it’s important to remember that monetizing your app means giving up control over your user base; make sure you don’t fall into any traps along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also be aware that many people are wary of apps that use their personal information, so tread carefully if you decide to go down this route.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to include an option for users to opt-out of data collection. While doing so will likely mean less profit, it’ll improve your reputation—and that alone may increase profits in other ways. Data Monetization is a very well-known business model for mobile applications.</span></p>

<h3><b>9. Advertising </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more popular app monetization models, advertising offers a way to make money from your free application by featuring ads in your app. Even if you want to offer an ad-free paid version of your application, it’s important to include advertising as a means of making money on mobile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with simply offering an ad-free version of your app is that most users don’t want to pay for something they can already get for free; it simply isn’t fair value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when you incorporate advertising into an existing free product, users feel as though they are getting something extra if they choose to upgrade to a paid version with no ads—instead of paying less for a product that is still covered in ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many apps use advertising to generate revenue while they build their user base and then transition to another model once they’ve established themselves and have enough users who are willing to pay for their service.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. Advertising on Freemium Apps</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15314" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inappadvertising-header-1.png" alt="mobile app model" width="682" height="342" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inappadvertising-header-1.png 1454w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inappadvertising-header-1-300x150.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inappadvertising-header-1-1024x513.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/inappadvertising-header-1-768x385.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The in-app purchase model is the popular Business Models In Android Applications. Although it has declined slightly in popularity over time, it still offers potential for many businesses to gain revenue and grow their user base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic premise of in-app purchases is that customers can make payments within your application for extra features or capabilities; these purchases will directly correlate with income generated by your company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-App purchases are a popular </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business model of mobile applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they offer users and customers an easy way to buy products from a platform they already enjoy using. Another benefit to using an in-app purchase system is that transactions happen without leaving your application, so you’re able to keep users engaged longer with less effort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This also means that if you have multiple applications available on different platforms, you can use a single payment gateway to manage all of them—and thus reduce costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, there are several benefits associated with using an in-app purchase system for your business. It’s important to note, however, that not all apps are well suited for such a model as some apps may not be able to support such a feature. You should consider whether or not your app would be suitable before moving forward with any changes.</span></p>

<p><b>What challenges may you encounter while using the Business Model for mobile applications?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying a Business Model is not easy. It takes time and planning to make sure your application will be successful. There are many different factors that need to be considered before launching your application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to understand what makes an app successful, how much it will cost, and how much revenue it can generate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s paramount to have a clear plan on how you want your app to be profitable before spending any money or time on development. If you are just looking for quick cash, there are many other ways of making money faster than developing an app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, you can face various challenges while using the Business Model for mobile applications. The main challenge is balancing app quality and monetization. Because users expect high-quality apps from developers, they may abandon your application if they don’t find value in it.</span></p>

<p><b>How to make your app available to as many people as possible?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can make your app available to as many people as possible by making it available on multiple platforms. By doing so, you will be competent to reach a wider audience and also increase your chances of getting more downloads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way is by working with affiliates and partners who have already established a good user base in specific regions or countries. This will help you reach out to new users quickly and easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also consider offering different versions of your app for free but with limited features, which will permit users to try out different functionalities before deciding whether or not they want to upgrade. </span></p>

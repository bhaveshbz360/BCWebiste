										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the Cost to Build WordPress Website? It is one of the questions we frequently get asked.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress powers more than 40 percent of websites all over the Internet, and has 50k+ plugins, which makes it a popular CMS for website development. If you are also planning to develop a website, WordPress is the right pick for its seamless UI, flexibility, and many features it is packed with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, it is important that you know the approximate amount you will be spending on WordPress development. Without further ado, let’s find out how much it will cost to build a WordPress website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average cost to build a WordPress website is approximately $200, or INR 15,000. However, depending on your needs, the cost to develop a WordPress website can range from $100 to $600 to $2500 to as high as $25,000 or more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of creating a WordPress website relies on several factors, such as: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type of website, </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goal of the website, and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Website’s features</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, you may need to spend money on themes, plug-ins, templates, and other components to achieve the result you are looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will discuss the </span>cost of building a WordPress website. Let’s get started.</p>
<h2><strong>Factors Determining WordPress Website Development Cost</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should consider several factors to determine the cost of WordPress website development.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-29590" title="Factors Determining WordPress Website Development Cost" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Factors-Determining-WordPress-Website-Development-Cost.jpg" alt="Factors Determining WordPress Website Development Cost" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Factors-Determining-WordPress-Website-Development-Cost.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Factors-Determining-WordPress-Website-Development-Cost-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Factors-Determining-WordPress-Website-Development-Cost-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plug-ins are extensions for your WordPress site. You must install these in order to add certain features to the website. There are more than 50,000 plug-ins available, but you should only install the most crucial ones for your website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you are building a simple WordPress website with the intent to promote your goods or services, consider using free plug-ins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you might also consider choosing the premium versions of plug-ins if you have a bigger budget and require additional functionality. The charges will increase as you install more plug-ins. Thus, it will raise the cost of your WordPress web and </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-development-services?utm_source=Valuecoders+-+29589-cost-of-building-wordpress-site&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">eCommerce Development Services</a>.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Themes</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Themes are an essential component of a WordPress website. You can create your WordPress theme if you know a bit about languages like HTML and CSS. On the other hand, consider choosing either Free or Paid WordPress Themes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free WordPress themes have fewer features and therefore load more quickly. If you have a limited budget or are creating a website solely to establish an online presence, consider using some of the <strong>top WordPress free themes, like Astra, Knight, etc</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you require additional functionality and want to keep your website secure, you might purchase premium versions of free WordPress themes. The premium versions of WordPress themes come in a wide pricing range. The <strong>themes are available for anywhere between $10 to $200</strong>. You can also consult web and </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-web-design?utm_source=Valuecoders+-+29589-cost-of-building-wordpress-site&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">eCommerce Web Design Services</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you make your decision.</span></p>

<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosting a website is a crucial component. It will enable others to view your website online. It is a place on the web server that you have paid for storing the files for your website. Although many hosting companies with a range of website hosting prices are available on the market, the three most well-known hosting companies are SiteGround, Bluehost, and A2 Hosting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are low on budget, you can purchase a hosting plan for at most $8 per month. If you invest more in your WordPress website and need more capabilities, you&#8217;ll need a <strong>$15–20 hosting package</strong>.</span></p>
<h3>Domain</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The domain name provides identification to your website on the web. You can choose a free domain if your hosting company has one with your hosting package. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also purchase a domain. <strong>A domain typically costs between $10 to $15 a year to purchase and maintain.</strong></span></p>
<h3>SSL Certificate</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To strengthen your WordPress website&#8217;s security, purchase an HTTPS/SSL certificate. However, purchasing a premium SSL certificate will increase the price of your WordPress website.</span></p>
<h2>Is WordPress is Too Expensive?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress is a free and open-source CMS used to build and manage a website. While the core software is free to download and use, you may have to pay for specific features or add-ons, such as themes, plug-ins, and hosting. These costs vary depending on the specific services and providers you choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in general, WordPress is very affordable, especially when compared to proprietary content management system platforms and building custom websites from scratch. You can also find a range of low and free-of-cost themes and plug-ins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many web hosting providers offer one-click WordPress installation. Your website can run without any technical expertise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also depends on the purpose of the website and its complexity. You can set up a basic brochure or portfolio website on a budget, but an eCommerce or complex custom web app would be costly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s check out the differences to know more.</span></p>
<h3>Ease of Use</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drupal can be quickly installed with beginner-friendly web hosting services. You can install an assortment of content management systems in the backend of your Drupal hosting environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The open source content management system has many installations, also known as distributions. If you know the type of website you intend to build, you can select one of these over a blank Drupal installation. Once you have set up Drupal with CMS hosting, you can access several customization choices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress is easy to install on most hosts. It takes only a few minutes. Most hosting settings have a one-click installation feature that guides you through the WordPress installation procedure.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3>SEO</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drupal can’t be updated from the UI and thus it may be a challenging task for professionals with little knowledge of development. You can rather<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-drupal-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong> hire a drupal developer</strong> </a>to complete the task. Besides the challenging update process, Drupal is an excellent choice for SEO. This content management system was created keeping the best SEO practices in mind, including integrated coaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also discover several add-ons such as Yoast SEO that can further improve your SEO. The Drupal community is not as large as the WordPress community but it’s useful and supportive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of using WordPress, updating your site&#8217;s various components is straightforward. You can do everything from the WordPress dashboard in a few clicks. Every part of your website must be updated to prevent security issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, WordPress is already fairly well-geared for SEO. You may add plug-ins like Yoast SEO to your website to improve your optimization efforts.</span></p>
<h3>Speed &amp; Performance</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drupal may be used to create high-performing websites that load quickly. Owing to its low resource requirements, it boosts response times, server communication, and your ability to manage websites with hundreds of pages. You also get the option to add other extensions that boost performance even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In comparison, speed is one of the significant drawbacks of WordPress. When we say that, we don’t mean that it cannot be quick, but many webmasters can’t optimize their websites properly. A website that loads quickly can be created by employing the best practices to speed up WordPress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, WordPress can deliver outstanding performance. However, loading speed and performance will decrease if you use excessive plug-ins, poorly written themes, and fail to optimize properly.</span></p>
<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drupal customizations are managed through modules and extensions and its plug-ins allow for customization. You can thoroughly modify your Drupal site. However, implementing these customizations  at times can be challenging if you don&#8217;t know how to code. Most of theseDrupal extensions require independent search, installation, and setup as they are not as user-friendly as WordPress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, there is a big range of plug-ins and themes for WordPress. Themes help to build the website&#8217;s foundation, and plug-ins will add more functions. In addition to a substantial collection of free plug-ins and themes, most themes and plug-ins also come in premium editions. The paid versions are better with added features and professional support.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why is WordPress the Best CMS?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the 10 reasons WordPress is the best CMS:</span></p>

<h2>Anywhere Accessibility</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reasons why WordPress is so popular is because it can be accessed from anywhere. You can simply log in and make changes to your website at home or on the go. A perfect feature for entrepreneurs to make quick updates on the site amidst their packed schedules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re working on an SEO strategy, it’s also nice to be able to make adjustments to your site wherever you are. You can use a smartphone or tablet rather than sitting at your desk and logging in with a desktop computer. This saves time and keeps you productive while on the go.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Huge Online Community Support</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the largest open source project in the world, WordPress has an army of passionate developers and supporters behind it. If you need help with your site, chances are someone has already written a tutorial or guide on how to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re wondering whether or not your site’s coding complies with best practices, there are people ready to assist. If you aren’t familiar with SQL, developers are waiting to help you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer number of development teams signify that there are plenty of options for you to choose from. You can use a local firm in your area or outsource to India, China, or South America if you want to go with more affordable options. Since firms always come and go, it pays to check out reviews online before hiring an outside firm for your website.</span></p>
<h2>Free Tutorials &amp; Training</h2>
<p>There are many other great CMSs in the market, like Drupal or Joomla, but they are not as user-friendly or intuitive as WordPress. For example, most people agree that uploading pictures in WordPress CMS<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is more accessible than in Drupal because there&#8217;s an easy-to-use interface.  The platform has a skilled team of professionals who keep their  WordPress community updated through various blogs and videos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people find it easier to navigate the dashboard in WordPress than Joomla or Drupal. Installing new plugins or themes is much faster in WordPress than in Joomla because everything is so organised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, if you have questions about how to get started with your website and don&#8217;t know where to turn, there are tutorials on the WordPress site that will walk you through every step.</span></p>

<h2>WordPress FAQs &amp; Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress Content Management System (CMS) is used by webmasters widely. It has many features and capabilities make it better than most other CMSs.The software is open source, which means you can modify the code to suit your needs. Here are some tips for you while doing wordpress FAQs and troubleshooting tips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAQs and troubleshooting:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Avoid frequently changing WP themes because this can affect your site&#8217;s speed</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Make sure plugins are updated often to keep them up-to-date with new bugs and vulnerabilities that have been discovered in their product since its last update release</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Remember that the more plugins and extensions you use on your website, the slower it will load</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Use Jetpack instead of several extensions if possible to simplify website usage</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Always backup everything before updating or modifying anything so that there is a fail-safe if something goes wrong</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Why Not just Use a Static CMS?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the primary reasons that make WordPress the best CMS over a static CMS like Jekyll or Hugo is because it’s much easier to use. If you’re not a developer, or don’t have any coding knowledge, then using a static CMS can be very difficult and frustrating. With WordPress, the only thing you need to do is install the content management system onto your website. Once that&#8217;s done, you&#8217;re ready to start adding posts or pages as required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Static Content Management Systems (CMS) are a popular choice for small businesses because they&#8217;re easy to use and manage. However, there are many disadvantages of using a static CMS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One disadvantage of using a static CMS is that it can be challenging to update and maintain. For instance, if your website needs to be updated with new features or content, you will need to update the entire CMS codebase. This can be time-consuming and challenging, specifically if you don&#8217;t have any development experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another disadvantage of using a static CMS is that it can be difficult to find the right template for your website. This is because most static <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/ecommerce-cms/top-cms-platform-for-website-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">CMS platforms</a> rely on pre-made templates that may not be suited for your specific business or website. You&#8217;ll likely need to customise these templates to fit your needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, static CMS platforms can be slow and inefficient when it comes to handling large volumes of traffic. They rely on pre-built templates and internal algorithms that can take longer than traditional web hosting solutions to load.</span></p>

<h2><strong>The Current Market For WordPress Websites</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many freelance developers and agency owners have been turning to open-source software to avoid potential pitfalls. Open source is a piece of computer code made freely available for use or modification. It also relates to a movement in programming that supports the open sharing of code, design, and other resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People increasingly use open source platforms like WordPress for their websites and web applications to save time &amp; money instead of spending thousands on custom development or commercial products like Drupal or Joomla. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both freelancers and business owners benefit from adding WordPress sites to their portfolios since it offers more work opportunities than competing platforms in a fiercely competitive market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress is currently the internet&#8217;s most popular Content Management System (CMS). This popularity is due to several reasons, including: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>WordPress is easy to use</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Unlike many other CMSs, which require a lot of technical knowledge to use, WordPress is simple to use. Anyone can create a website using it.</span></li>
<li><b>WordPress is affordable.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most WordPress websites cost around $100 to build, which is much lower than the price of most custom-built CMSs.</span></li>
<li><b>WordPress is versatile.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress can be used to buid websites for any purpose – from small businesses to large enterprises.</span></li>
<li><b>WordPress is reliable.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thousands of websites are powered by WordPress CMS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> everyday, and there have never been any serious problems.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress has all the features you need, is intuitive and customizable enough that anyone can do it, while also being low-priced and reliable. You could say that WordPress is pretty much guaranteed to be able to handle whatever your website needs are.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP is a strategy to create and deliver a basic version of a product to customers to receive feedback.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of an MVP in Software Development is to validate a product idea quickly and cheaply without incurring the cost and risk of developing a full-fledged product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By starting with a small, imperfect product, businesses can gather feedback from early adopters and iterate rapidly to create a final product that better meets the market&#8217;s needs. While MVPs have become popular in the software industry, they can be applied to any type of product development.</span></p>

<h2><b>Role Of MVP Development Services In Software Projects </b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26147 " title="Role of MVP in Software Development" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Role-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png" alt="Role of MVP in Software Development" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Role-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Role-of-MVP-in-Software-Development-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching a new software development project is always risky. There&#8217;s no guarantee that the finished product will be well-received by users or even work as intended. MVPs are often used to test new ideas and gather feedback from users, helping to reduce the risk of launching a full-scale development project. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, an MVP can be built relatively quickly and cheaply, making it an appealing option for startups and small businesses. Building an MVP also has the benefit of helping to focus the development team on the essential features of the product. By starting with an MVP, you can avoid wasting time and money on features that may never be used.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ultimately, whether or not to build an MVP is a decision that depends on the risks and rewards of your particular project. But in many cases, an MVP can help to reduce the risks of launching a new software development project.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Make Your Business More Productive With MVP Software Development" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7Fk-9J0TcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Determine The Direction of Design</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an MVP helps you validate the concept and get a fresh perspective regarding the features and interface elements that users may expect from a similar product. The data collected becomes handy in developing and designing the software to fulfill the audience&#8217;s expectations. </span></p>
<h3>Improvised Functionality</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP development services ensure the system&#8217;s proper functioning aligns with the business vision. Getting custom features in a product requires a skilled and resourceful team for better functioning. It is better to catch the bugs or any other deficiency in the development stage to avoid delays after the final release.</span></p>
<h3>Develop a Unique Set of Features for The Product</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An innovative MVP in Software development aims to solve recurring problems with understandable working principles. It enables you to make an easy-to-use product. The users get a faster and more efficient solution to their problem, and the development teams get their desired outcomes.</span></p>

<h3>Precise Project Planning</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working on a minimum viable project imbibes the full concept of software. It decides on features and technology stack selection. MVP often works as a reference point while working on a product.   </span></p>
<h2><b>Benefits Of An MVP In Software Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It aims to get the product out to the market quickly, so it can begin generating feedback from real users. First, it allows for more rapid iteration and experimentation. Since only the essential features are included in the MVP, there is less code to write and test. This makes it easier to make changes and try out new ideas. Second, an MVP can help to reduce development costs. By starting with a smaller scope, it is possible to cut down on costly features that may never be used. Finally, an MVP  can help you get your product to market faster. By focusing on the core functionality, you can get your product in front of users sooner and begin gathering critical feedback.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26150 " title="Benefits of MVP in Software Development" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Benefits-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png" alt="Benefits of MVP in Software Development" width="541" height="406" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Benefits-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Benefits-of-MVP-in-Software-Development-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></p>
<h3><b>Present A Better Picture To Stakeholders and Investors</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups include minimum viable products in their pitch deck. An MVP in software development gives investors and stakeholders a risk-free decision-making process. It helps increase your brand awareness and attract skilled talent with an improved vision and upgraded idea of your functional product.</span></p>
<h3>Better Cost-Efficiency of The Project</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP gives a better outlook of the necessary features required for the product&#8217;s success. It helps avoid unpopular methods among the beta testers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP helps the teams avoid building excess complex solutions. The development and maintenance costs witness an exponential reduction and a better understanding of the required talent before hiring extensive departments.</span></p>
<h3>Retain Focus on The End Goal</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP reduces uncertainty and deters the team from procrastination. It helps shorten the feedback loop and enhances the overall development speed. </span></p>

<h3>Less Room for Error</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project gets more complex with the increased involvement of people and systems. The development process becomes harder to control. Newcomers in software development get used to the system. It avoids complexity and reduces potential errors. <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mvp-app-development-company?utm_source=Web+Blog&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=ValueCoders" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">MVP development services</a> help reduce system shutdowns and facilitate maintenance management.  </span></p>
<h3>Better Relations with Prospective Customers</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP prepares the viable groundwork for product development. The development teams create a solution for the audience as the marketing team builds connections and spreads the word around the web. It enables you to attract daily active users to your future product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While an MVP in software development has many benefits, it is important to remember that it also has some risks. First, since an MVP is usually released with few features, it may not be able to meet all of the customer’s needs. This could lead to early user attrition. Second, an MVP may generate negative feedback if it is not well-received by the market. It is important to have a plan for how you will address this feedback before releasing your MVP. Overall, an MVP can be a great way to develop and release your software product rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being productive is key to success in any field, but it can be difficult to maintain a high level of productivity day after day. That&#8217;s where the MVP system comes in. MVP stands for &#8220;minimum viable product.&#8221; The idea is to create the simplest possible version of your product or service that still meets your customers&#8217; needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It enables you to avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary details and to stay focused on what&#8217;s most important. Additionally, MVP development services help you get customer feedback more quickly and make better use of your limited resources. Keeping your product or service as simple as possible keeps you focused on what&#8217;s most important and gets it done quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<h2>Successful Businesses that Started With MVP Development</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26151 size-full" title="Famous Companies that Started with MVP Development" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Famous-Companies-that-Started-with-MVP-Development.png" alt="Famous Companies that Started with MVP Development" width="512" height="384" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Famous-Companies-that-Started-with-MVP-Development.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Famous-Companies-that-Started-with-MVP-Development-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are no guarantees in the business world, developing a minimum viable product (MVP) can increase your chances of success. MVPs allow entrepreneurs to test their assumptions about a product or service before investing significant time and resources. If the MVP is well-received, it can provide valuable feedback that can be used to fine-tune the final product. Launching an MVP can generate buzz and create interest in a business before it is fully up and running. It helps attract potential customers and investors. Many notable companies have started with MVP development, including big names like Dropbox, Airbnb, and Tinder.</span></p>
<h3>Meta (Formerly Facebook)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started with the name &#8220;The Facebook.&#8221; As an MVP product, it helped American students stay connected with friends from other schools. Initially, it became operational in four universities. Access was granted to everyone without any geographical barrier after it was successfully tested for a year.</span></p>
<h3>Dropbox</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox is a known file-hosting company. It implemented the MVP approach in the form of an explanatory video that demonstrated the possibilities and innovative functions of the technology. Surprisingly, signups increased 5 times in just one night without an actual product.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it has over 600 million users. By testing the business hypothesis and learning the actual market needs, Dropbox used the MVP strategy without releasing the actual software.</span></p>
<h3>Groupon</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original idea was changed/modified with time to meet the market needs. As an MVP product, it gathered people with the intent of helping each other and running a crowdfunding campaign or boycotting some negligent stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original idea was modified to gather people for a crowdfunding campaign and boycotting negligent stores. Users started promoting its special coupons and promo codes. Manual emails were sent to individual customers for effective resolution of the requests. It helped save costs on software development and get better results from testing the product viability that later served global customers.</span></p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started as an SMS communication platform among Odeo, a podcasting platform, and employees. The MVP product provided only an SMS-sending facility without hashtags, replies, reposts, etc. Later, it developed into the modern world of Twitter with all its accustomed features.</span></p>

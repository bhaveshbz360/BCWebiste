										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the use of online payment is increasing rapidly, and every online platform gives you a choice of paying online through various platforms, it makes things easier for the users to pay securely and fast.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1228757/online-banking-users-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the use of online and mobile banking is estimated to increase steadily between 2020 and 2024, with the Asian market being the largest. As of 2020, more than 1.9 billion individuals globally actively used online banking services, with that the number estimate to reach 2.5 billion by 2024.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the emergence of various online selling and purchasing platform, there has been a rise of different unique online payment modules like PayPal or Stripe. We can see a number of businesses and organizations are deploying these online payment modules, and one of the prestigious clients asked ValueCoders to develop a world-class online payment banking app. The motive of this app is to build an online payment module that can allow users to do the transaction from anywhere to everywhere. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Let&#8217;s discuss further how ValueCoders developed a world-class online payment banking app:</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the top </span>banking software development company<b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">our main priority was to give the desired app to the client and include as many customizations as the client need in order to build a <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/wealth-management-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">financial wealth app</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, many banking software companies have started making applications that can help you with an easy transaction, we @ValueCoders provide the same benefit with more secure options, and users can buy the SENs (Complementary currency), and they will be able to use them for day to day transactions within their cities.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Technologies we used while developing an App</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Node.JS</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">React Native</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Node.JS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Node.JS is a well-known open-source, cross-platform, backend JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Node.JS can be used for building Banking Software Application that requires real-time data calculations and stats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it was our primary choice for this </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/industries/banking-financial-services#utm_source=Ang_n12&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_id=21527bankingappcasestudy" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>Banking software application</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because if more than 1 million people are using the app simultaneously, Node. JS can easily handle that, as it is a good choice for large-scale apps relying on real-time data.</span></p>
<p><b>React Native:  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">React Native is also an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. Many big industries use this tool for building applications, and because it is very efficient and perfect for mobile apps, We use it for giving a better experience to the users. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Challenges Faced While Creating Online Payment Banking App</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The client wanted to make an app with solid malware, as it is a matter of transaction of money; it has to be taken care of. And the online banking apps consisted of many variables. There was some functionality of currency changes within the master admin panel, where the admin could change the currency value per SEN.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this led to the change in calculations within the application after getting it done. And the analysis was very complex, and our project management team understood the queries/calculations and tackled them by closely coordinating the results with the client. </span></p>
<p><b>The application involves currency and payment transactions, so it was necessary to keep it as fully secure as possible. We used AWS EC2 Server with SSL Layer and Amazon S3 Server for Images to meet security demand. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has always been quite fun to deal with such kinds of situations. We are a group of talented professionals and developers who know how to tackle different aspects and problems while developing an app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome some challenges, The team of ValueCoders used some </span>Banking Software Solutions<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and focused on developing the application with all the latest updates. </span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><b>SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED BY US</b></span></h2>
<p><b>Requirement Analysis</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this particular segment, we try to gather every possible information from stakeholders and document the same. It helps us remember all the key factors and helps develop the app with all functionalities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We follow the &#8220;SMART&#8221; rule for creating the documentation, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And after finalizing the document, the wireframes are created, which acts as a blueprint defining the feel of the platform with respect to all functionalities. Having proper documentation of what you need and achieving the target is always necessary for better results. We always have documentation to present directly to the client to understand the project better. </span></p>
<p><b>Designing Phase</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing an app is like climbing a stair; you will face another challenge with one step up until you reach your destination. Similarly, after creating a wireframe, we move to the designing phase, in which our UX/UI developers design every single module and theme color. Every module is interlinked with functionality having some dummy data in use.</span></p>
<p><b>Execution Phase</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the designing part, our Backend developers develop all the initials API, and frontend developers integrate all available APIs with best practices making dynamic to all the screens. </span></p>
<p><b>Client Request Based Project Delivery</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving the best product to our client is our main motive, and just because of that, we constantly get in touch with the client after passing even a single module so that the client can check that and suggest anything more required. In this case also, while developing a </span>banking software application<span style="font-weight: 400;">, we connected with the client after passing every phase.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers are connected in conversations with clients daily and follow their ideas or suggestions. In case of any feasibility challenge, developers give the alternative solution and try clients to be on the same phase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clients also mention the Jira and assign the task to developers as per their priority. This process helps us meet the client&#8217;s expectations in the best possible manner and ensure the timely delivery of the tasks.</span></p>
<p><b>Deployment Phase</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all of that, in the deployment phase, we do the testing and see if the App is ready to use or not, and doing proper unit testing on a local machine merge with develop branch and deploying to the dev server helps us to know more about App. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any issues are found, the developer&#8217;s team tries to find them out and resolve them before delivering the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we send PR (pull request) for the main branch that will be deployed on the live server after review. We are using AWS servers for all kinds of deployment.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days when finance was an industry running over paper and pen, now it is tech-driven and changed the landscape by 180 degrees. Fintech, the conjuncture of finance and technology, is bringing in enormous ease and automation in finance activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From secure &amp; faster transactions to banking on fingertips, technology has changed the face of finance. The global fintech market is expected to surpass $26.5 trillion in 2022. The advancement in this space is continuous, and the COVID-19 crisis has pushed the enhancement. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19772" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f2.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f2.png 1280w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f2-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-fintech-investments-surged-in-2018-with-investments-in-china-taking-the-lead-accenture-analysis-finds-uk-gains-sharply-despite-brexit-doubts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a wide range of opportunities to users, fintech has grown a hot topic among investors, entrepreneurs, and startup enthusiasts. If you are thinking out loud about making a fortune with a fintech app idea, then you must be wondering what types of solutions you can develop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will take a look at fintech app ideas that can open the gates of opportunities and success. So, stay hooked until the end of this write-up. </span></p>
<h2><b>Finance App Ideas To Invest &amp; Begin A Startup In 2023 </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finance apps are becoming a handy tool among people, as they are finding ease in making payments, sending/receiving money, contactless payment, expense management, and more. Thus, having a fintech development &amp; startup with a mind-blowing app idea can enable you to capture the market and allow you to achieve success in the meantime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering what different types of finance apps you can launch to kickstart your startup business? Let&#8217;s take a glance at them. </span></p>
<h3><b>#1. P2P Payment Apps </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a huge influx in peer-to-peer money transfer practice in the recent couple of years. The growth graph of this market is booming at a constant pace and looking forward to developing a P2P money transfer application that can turn out the biggest hit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the well-known applications of this space are Venmo, Zelle, PayPal, and Google Play. However, there is still room for faster and secure applications. Actually, these applications have their own regional restrictions when it comes to money transfers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19771 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f3.png" alt="" width="1013" height="511" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f3.png 1013w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f3-300x151.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/f3-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1013px) 100vw, 1013px" /><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://www.unifiedinfotech.net/blog/how-to-build-a-p2p-payment-app-expert-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></span></p>

While developing software and managing operations require a huge some time to deliver value to end customers. Due to this, the work field becomes a war field where businesses fight to deliver value to customers.  </span></p>
<h2><strong>Here comes the DevOps. It delivers a great number of benefits to organizations: </strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Fast Delivery time: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic principles of DevOps &#8211; automatic, continuous delivery, and fast response loop &#8211; focus on creating software to improve performance quickly and efficiently. DevOps, an extension of the agile system, uses automation to keep SDLC flowing at ease. By promoting a culture of interaction &amp; greater collaboration, it provides a measure of rapid and continuous responses so that any issues are fixed over time and the release is done quickly.</span></li>
<li><b>High-level collaboration:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Today, more than ever, development teams need to break the branch-office and engage in active communication, 24 hours a day. DevOps paves the way for business development by providing the necessary spirit of collaboration, communication, and integration between the globally distributed teams in IT. Boundaries are set by activities that are transparent in the DevOps stimulus environment. All team members are responsible for meeting the desired features/quality and timing of what will be brought together.</span></li>
<li><b>Quality customer experience</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: With DevOps, organizations can increase their frequency by 200x, turnaround time by 24x, and reduce change to error rates by 3x. By adjusting the transmission line, it becomes possible to have the reliability and stability of the application after each new release. If the application works seamlessly in creation, organizations benefit from greater customer satisfaction.</span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering these aspects, it was decided to implement DevOps into banking solutions and transform the .Net Framework to .NetCore. In this article, we would have a complete case study of this transformation. So, stay tuned with me.</span></li>
<li><b>Implementing DevOps In Banking Solution &amp; Changing .Net Into. NetCore </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product is a banking solution that caters to credit societies and cooperative banks. The application was running slow, and users were facing issues with updates. So, we decided to change the legacy technology and cater to an agile solution with higher scalability. </span></li>

<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Major Challenges </b></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system has got so many loopholes that need to be fixed, and we encountered so many challenges such as: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of resources in the test and build environment caused excessively long software builds and test cycles.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The delivery date was due because of quality and efficiency issues. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our quality team finds a variety of issues, and customer work also caused rapid and inadequate test coverage. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The version of the software was unstable, and there were a variety of problems that weren’t detected during the testing phase. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the migration from .Net Framework to .NetCore and implementation of DevOps solution to increase efficiency, deployment of high-quality code, and scaling the demand.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deciding what automated DevOps tool would be best for implementation. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were major challenges, and our team had to undergo rigorous research and strategy development to implement DevOps in this software system. But! Our most critical challenge was to decide on an automation tool for deploying DevOps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, here we are enumerating some tools that you may find useful in implementing DevOps in your system software.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #003366;"><b>DevOps Automation Tools That You Must Know </b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no dearth of DevOps Automation Tools that you can use, but it completely depends on your need for development. Here I am discussing a tool for .net that you can use to implement DevOps. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>1) Azure</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most popular and latest option, availed by Microsoft, is a fully functional integrated DevOps, named Azure Pipelines. It gets plugged in into an existing project with nicety and enables lots of options to use for the teams. Azure pipeline enables you to integrate containerization like Kubernetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It functions for a serverless option, swiftly deployed Azure Web Apps, and severely complex VMs. This tool is a one-stop shop for streamlining the work of .net developers. Azure DevOps service enables you to free CI/CD targets via an Azure Repo or GitHub repo. Moreover, the pricing depends on the number of pipelines or user licenses you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-17996" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0-63.png" alt="Azure" width="803" height="366" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0-63.png 1029w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0-63-300x137.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0-63-1024x467.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0-63-768x350.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/microsoft-azure-devops-what-you-need-to-know" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></p>
<h3><b>2) Azure Pipelines</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure Pipelines is the backbone of Azure DevOps that handles the traffic of each offer. It is a major platform and language agnostic and provides orchestration between cloud providers, both AWS and Azure. Basically, the pipeline itself is cloud-hosted, which means you don’t need to download and install anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipelines have lots of extensibility and enable you to leverage a good built-in option for integrated reporting and testing. If you have just begun with performing CI/CD in the cloud-hosted world, then the documentation works excellent, and workflow helps you entirely do things right.  </span></p>

<h3><b>3) Kudu</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes you don’t need a fancy arrangement for your project. For quick projects where I needed constant integration with Azure web apps (formerly Azure websites), I hosted the app; I used the Kudu Service App build server that was connected to my GitHub hosted repository. Azure is a little trivial to set any application service you create directly from the deployment center menu to the Azure UI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kudu monitors your GitHub login and rewrites your code, and converts it to Azure whenever a change occurs. One of the most painful ways to set up a CI / CD quickly is when you need MSBuild to compile your app and deploy your update service. Bonus Works for free &#8211; the only paid part is the cost of your Azure App service. It comes on the go and does not require a separate Azure DevOps subscription.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are major automation tools that you can use to implement DevOps. However, we used various different solutions to implement the solution due to obvious reasons. Now, let’s glance at the implementation of the project into DevOps settings.  </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Implementing a solution to the requirement with the following approach</b></span></h2>

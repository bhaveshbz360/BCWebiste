										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has ideas. But do we realize how difficult thriving, workable products or services? Indeed, a hard nut to crack. You need to be innovative while still delivering worth a penny.</p>
<p>According to McKinsey Global Institute data, only 1 out of 7 ideas result in a successful product, and the failure rates for newly launched products are between 25%-45%. Using a structured approach, you’ll stand a greater chance of avoiding any pitfalls resulting in your new product’s failure.</p>
<p>As said by late Apple founder Steve Jobs: “People are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”</p>
<p>But that does not guarantee that the new product will sell like hotcakes. You need to invest time with good command of customer &amp; market needs, your competitors, and offering products with clear value to beat the odds.</p>
<p><strong>This is where the 7 Stages Of Product Development Help:</strong></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20074 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839.png" alt=" Stages Of Product Development " width="2048" height="368" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839.png 2048w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-300x54.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-1024x184.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-768x138.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-1536x276.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involving customers at the early stage helps NPD process and understand their problem before executing ideas into process, tools, and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Necessity leads to invention. That’s where the New Product development Process(NDP) will help. A very simplified process to convert ideas into a tested concept into viable products and eliminate non-feasible ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where the </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/stages-of-new-product-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">new product development process (</a></strong>NDP<strong>)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes into play. This process is designed to aid the conversion of new and untested concepts into viable products and market them while allowing you to weed out non-feasible ideas.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Is New Product Development?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New product development is all about converting an idea into a business-strategic workable software development product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Product Development (NPD) process involves researching existing products in the market with a customer-centric approach, feasibility of the idea, delivering working software and latching on the market opportunities, and delivering working software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product development is an umbrella term that covers six stages of SDLC and working and has a POC. The</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Product Development</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">approach revolves around an entirely new idea, where the uncertainty around its development and the next option remains high. Software</span> product development companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">are progressively exploring NPD facets to address development glitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is about releasing the latest software product, you should seek services from leading </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software product development services</a><b>;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then, always a fair <strong>idea</strong> to join hands with leading firms.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 1: Idea Generation</b></h2>
<p><strong>Emphasize On Customer Problems: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good entrepreneur can scan the issues faced by the target audiences.  You can always identify the issues the customer is facing.</span></p>
<h3><strong>a) Personal Roadblocks</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or a buyer, the customer&#8217;s tendency always remains the same. All you need to do is prioritize one problem, derive a solution, and tag it” one for all. If you’re looking to set the tone right before product development, subscribing to </span>product design and development companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">could help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to apply your brain behind digital offerings. The communication gap often leads to many problems&#8212;&#8211; and is the biggest hurdle towards the path to productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a product and launching it can have some ups and downs, but there should focus on making up a great business idea.</span></p>
<h3><b>b) </b><b>Qualify Each Of The Listed Problems</b></h3>
<p><b>Here is the 4 U strategy:</b></p>
<p>Let’s discuss each of these aspects in detail.</p>
<p><b>Unworkable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out whether the brainstormed product concepts will address some real problems. Will the product be able to fill the existing customer experience gaps and will achieve product-market fit?</span></p>
<p><b>Unavoidable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the problem that you are working on inevitable to the extent that it becomes mandatory to comply? You need to find out whether solving that problem is a choice or a compulsion.</span></p>
<p><b>Urgent:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is the problem urgent and is highly demandable by the target market? If the answer is affirmative, this could be your chance to cover the white space in the market with your original product.</span></p>
<p><b>Underserved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there no available products that address the existing user problems? Look for the whitespace in the market and hold on to the idea that looks promising.</span></p>
<h3><b>c) </b><b>Emerging With Possible Solutions </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the problem gets figured out, you can start looking for possible solutions with a </span>product development firm <span style="font-weight: 400;">to produce feasible solutions. For every new user problem, there’ll be a new NPD service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have figured out the problem, it’s time to look for possible solutions. For every user problem, there ought to be potential new product development opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the workflow that starts from a problem and ends up with strategizing around the solution.</span></p>
<h3><b>d) Narrowing Down The Problems</b></h3>
<p>Categorize all shortlisted problems using a comparison chart with solutions<b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Circulate the findings across the organizational structure to come up with a viable problem set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case stakeholders are reserved, you can Replicate, Re-purpose, and with an upgrade approach.</span></p>
<p><b>Replicate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  You can create a similar product with. a competitor and launch it in the new market conditions. Once MVP(Minimum Viable Product) is launched, then you should prioritize out-of-the-box features.</span></p>
<p><b>Re-Purpose</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  You can rewire the existing business model and present it in the most viable manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It focuses on rewiring an existing business model—for instance, LinkedIn Learning &amp; e-learning platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Upgrading: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This concept of NPD revolves around the existing model with some improvements. Be it performance, speed, or addressing challenges of competitors with added functionalities. </span></p>

<hr />
<h2><b>Stage 2: Idea Screening</b><b>      </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new product development stage is about choosing the idea that gives you the highest potential for success. You can put all your ideas collectively for internal review, i.e., seek the advice of people with industry knowledge and experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When developing a new product idea, leverage the advantage of POC (Proof of Concept) to check the feasibility of the concept. One can’t zero on an idea that is not technically feasible to build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can consult the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/on-demand-teams/why-startups-choose-dedicated-teams-for-agile-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Agile development teams</a>&#8212;&#8211;expertise helps understand the technical side of things and helps shortlist ideas worth building a PoC. In India, </span>software product development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> leading-age technology solutions give the prospects a smooth development experience</span></p>
<p><b>SWOT (</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities &amp; Threats</span><b>) </b>is prevalent and good practice while shortlisting New Product development ideas.</p>
<p>The agile development team, product owner, scrum master, and product manager go through a detailed analysis and shortlist ideas&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; opportunities and strengths, threats picture and weaknesses.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a SWOT is relatively simple, and you need a simple 2×2 grid to get started:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWOT Analysis Template | New Product Development</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, your New Product Development idea should be unique so that you do not have to convince people to pay for it.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 3: Concept Development &amp; Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluation of value proposition is the first step towards testing and development. It ensures you assess the problem in advance and can course-correct earlier. It saves from piling new technical debts.</span></p>
<p><b>These steps easy-to-follow steps include :</b></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantifying gain/pain Ratio</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a competitor analysis </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enlisting major product features</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a value proposition chart</span></span></li>

<h2><b>Stage 4: Value Proposition Strategy </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great asset of </span>product development companies in India <span style="font-weight: 400;">before they launch any product. You should be very particular about the capabilities of new products. Once you are good to go with the idea’s utility, you can pitch it clearly to the end-user. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It ensures that a product or service positions around customer exact values and needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the form of a </span>value proposition<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can showcase what your product is capable of doing.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20135" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.png" alt=" value proposition" width="566" height="276" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.png 850w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4-300x146.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4-768x374.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<h2><b>Stage 5:Concept Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are ready with the proposition in </span>software product development<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can now present it to the set of selected customers. The key is to have trust and belief in your ideas. Since the concept doesn’t look promising, you’ll repeat steps to develop a new project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get meaningful insight by focusing on four critical aspects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identification of the focus group, i.e., people who would benefit from the new product under development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessment of other alternatives to be offered to the focus group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Devising a foolproof plan for the New Product Development right from features, marketing, pricing, and distribution</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integration of unique product features into the customer’s mind for findability and discoverability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20136" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5.png" alt="" width="543" height="831" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5.png 1132w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-196x300.png 196w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-668x1024.png 668w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-768x1176.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-1003x1536.png 1003w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /></p>

<h2><b>Stage 6: Product Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span>product development software companies<span style="font-weight: 400;"> start, execution of ideas occurs, the business strategy is documented &#8212;- you can go ahead with the product development cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Product Development starts with developing the prototype followed by MVP.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Prototype</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creation of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/product-ui-ux-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">UI/UX of the product</a> and share with the stakeholders helps visualize the product’s feasibility in the marketplace.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</b></h3>
<p>Using Agile for the new products gives a different look.  Once the product goes through the design &amp; steps &#8212; the product gets launched with minimal features.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile Product development is better than conventional. The waterfall model complements the to-and-fro movement across the development cycle and ideal for last-time changes.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20137" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.png" alt="" width="435" height="326" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Maintaining Communication &amp; Synchronization are the key highlights of Agile Model</b></p>
<h2><b>Stage 7: Market Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps in New Product Development aims to reduce the uncertainty revolving around the </span>software product development<span style="font-weight: 400;">, i.e., checking the viability of the new product or its marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>There are two market testing strategies to follow:</b></p>
<h3><b>1. Alpha Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of testing allows testing engineers to judge any product based on performance and map the marketing mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of any issues, the changes are planned and implemented before the final go-ahead.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Beta Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selected group of customers gives unbiased feedback to the organization. It is all about listening to customers’ voices when issuing a move back to the development team for fixtures.</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s how Alpha and Beta testing are different from each other:</b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20139" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf.png" alt="" width="513" height="471" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf.png 750w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /></p>
<p>The third form of testing conveyed product validation and is called In-Home Usage Test (IIHUT). Development products are meant for intended customers who will use the products.</p>

<h2><b>Shopify Cons</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there are many benefits of Shopify website, like everything, it also has its limitations or disadvantages. Let’s have a look at some of the cons of Shopify:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Monthly Fees</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify offers a monthly subscription fee, which can add up over time. There are different pricing plans available, but even the basic plan can be a significant expense for small businesses.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Transaction Fees</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to monthly fees, Shopify charges transaction fees if you use payment gateways other than Shopify Payments. This can increase your overall costs, especially if you have a high volume of sales.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Limited Customization</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Shopify provides many themes and customization options, there are limits to how much you can modify the design and functionality without advanced technical skills. For more complex customizations, you might need to hire a developer.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>App Costs</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the apps that enhance your Shopify store come with additional costs. Depending on the number of apps you need, these costs can add up quickly, increasing your overall expenses.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Platform Dependency</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Shopify, your store is dependent on the platform. If Shopify experiences downtime or technical issues, your store could be affected. Additionally, if you decide to switch to another platform, migrating your store can be challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By weighing these cons against the benefits of Shopify, you can hire Shopify programmers and take an informed decision about whether Shopify is the right for your business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s start the main topic of this blog i.e.  WooCommerce vs Shopify vs Magento. But before jumping into the WooCommerce vs Shopify vs Magento road, let me give you a brief introduction to these platforms. </span></p>

<p><b><i>Build an Online Business- No Matter What Business You’re In </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify started as an online store in 2004 with the name “Snowdevil”. It later became an eCommerce platform in 2007 and its retailers earned a net sales of nearly $100 million in 2009. Currently, Shopify has more than 820,000 merchants as its customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify has become a big hit among its customers these days as it is more like a software-as-a-service where non-technical people can easily sign up and use it and get their online store running on it in no time. There are no complications, a learning curve present, and the interface is amazingly intuitive. </span></p>
<p><b><i>Following are some of the big organizations that have partnered with Shopify &#8211; </i></b></p>

<p><b><i>Build exactly the eCommerce Website You Want </i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce runs more than 29.1% of all eCommerce stores, which nearly amount to almost 3.0 million stores. WooCommerce is primarily a WordPress plugin that one has to deploy after they have bought a domain for the website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main reason behind the popularity of WooCommerce is that it&#8217;s very simple to build an eCommerce website if you are a WordPress user already. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user interface is quite easy but one does require some basic CSS or HTML knowledge to build and maintain their online store on WooCommerce. </span></p>
<p><b><i>Following are some of the organizations that partnered with WooCommerce- </i></b><b></b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, Magento has nearly 250,000eCommerce websites with a 10.0% share in the top-notch 1 million eCommerce websites across the globe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magento is one of the most popular and acknowledged customizable eCommerce platforms one can find. It started in 2007 and scored more than 5,00,000 customers quite easily.  Magento has two main services- </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is open source </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another is Magento Commerce </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first one, anyone can easily sign up and build a website for free. In the second one, the services are paid and offer all hosting services.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Following are some big brands that partnered with Magento-</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-15661 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brands-partnered-with-magento-.png" alt="brands-partnered-with-magento-" width="500" height="200" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brands-partnered-with-magento-.png 500w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brands-partnered-with-magento--300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, coming to the main topic Shopify vs. WooCommerce vs. Magento- which one is the best? </span></p>
<h2><b>WooCommerce vs Shopify vs Magento- Which one to Choose?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Performance &amp; Scalability </b><b><br />
</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>&#8211; MAGENTO</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magento is massively powerful and easily accommodates hundreds of products along with huge website traffic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are one of them who have a big business or are planning to expand the business then Magento can be an extremely efficient content management system for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magento is quite scalable and you can easily reduce or increase the resources your website needs depending on the traffic inflow. This literally means you don’t have to experience any barrier in website crashes or speed downfalls during a sudden change in traffic. </span><b></b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15682 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/magento-banner.jpg" alt="magento development" width="810" height="152" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/magento-banner.jpg 810w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/magento-banner-300x56.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/magento-banner-768x144.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></a></p>
<h4><b>&#8211; Shopify</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shopify, when it comes to site performance &amp; speed it fares well. In fact, website speed is one of the main benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now talking about scalability, it does not perform well compared to the other two<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-10-ecommerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> eCommerce platforms</a>, which can prove to be a barrier if your business increases. If you need a smooth workflow for your business then you can go for Shopify plus. But this may also increase your cost heavily. </span></p>
<h4><b>&#8211; WooCommerce</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows scalability but people with less experience and no experience might find it difficult to map their websites according to the requirements. If you don’t have any coding backgrounds then you may find WoooCommerce scalable for you at all. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><b><i><span style="color: #008000;">So the winner is</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">Magento </span></i></b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire an <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-development-services?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=ecommerce-15659-d7&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">eCommerce web development company</a> to build a secure, and scalable website on the Magento platform.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Seo Effectiveness </b><b></b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-15671 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-2.png" alt="seo-ecommerce-website" width="598" height="239" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-2.png 500w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-2-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></h4>
<h4>&#8211; MAGENTO</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It offers advanced SEO features along with inbuilt efficient analytics. It generates SEO friendly meta description, URLs, and integrates Google site maps that are too auto-generated in websites and automates image resizing and watermarking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with these features, SEO can be smoothly personalized suiting your website requirements if you hold the required skill set. According to a study conducted in 2019, it was revealed that Magento had an SEO score of 100 out of 100. </span><b></b></p>
<h4><b>&#8211; Shopify </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well,  being the first eCommerce store, Shopify is surely optimized for SEO but the only issue is that it doesn&#8217;t spare much room for personalization. There are various SEO practices available for your business but the problem is you won&#8217;t be able to deploy them as Shopify doesn’t allow. </span></p>
<h4><b>&#8211; WooCommerce</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce has a plethora of extensions and plugins available that helps in a good degree of SEO. Users can easily tweak their settings as they like according to their website to make them better. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><b><i><span style="color: #008000;">So We have Two Winners here:</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">Magento &amp; WooCommerce</span></i></b><b></b></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><b>Reliability &amp; Support </b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-15664 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shopify-woocommerce-magento-support.png" alt="shopify-woocommerce-magento-support" width="558" height="223" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shopify-woocommerce-magento-support.png 500w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shopify-woocommerce-magento-support-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></h4>
<h4><b>&#8211; Magento </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magento has a whopping community of nearly 3,00,000 members. With certified and amateur members in the team who are contributing to these communities, it is quite hard to search for help if you are facing any problems. </span></p>
<h4><b>&#8211; Shopify </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify offers 24*7 support to its customers. The response time is very good and they are quite prompt with their solutions and replies. You can anytime reach customer service and connect through email, live chat, and phone calls. </span></p>
<h4><b>&#8211; WooCommerce </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommerce is basically a WordPress plugin and you might be aware of the fact that the WordPress community is immense. You can smoothly run the platform, take the help easily, and avail yourself the numerous benefits from plugins and code created by developers in the community to improve your website functionality. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="color: #008000;">So the winner is</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">Shopify. </span></i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Safety &amp; Security </b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>&#8211; Magento </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Magento, safety &amp; security is not a problem at all. If you have a team of efficient developers and hosting servers at your disposal nothing is as secure as Magento then. Further, Magento was the first eCommerce platform that kept the security of data as the priority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It offers security patches and there are a plethora of security plugins and extensions provided for securing the data. </span></p>
<h4><b>&#8211; Shopify</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since everything is globally hosted on Shopify, the platform is quite safe and secure. It keeps an eye on your server-side maintenance and timely regulates it. It also offers you a free SSL certificate and maintains PCI compliances for you. </span></p>
<h4><b>&#8211; WooCommerce</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WooCommece keeps you updated all the time for bug security and fixing. The users need not worry about their security as the team working on the WooCommerce platform always monitors and alters the code to decrease such threats. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15683 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/woardpress-developers.jpg" alt="wordpress developers" width="810" height="152" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/woardpress-developers.jpg 810w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/woardpress-developers-300x56.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/woardpress-developers-768x144.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, there are also a plethora of security plugins available too that protect the website from every possible virus attack and hackers. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><b><i><span style="color: #008000;">So the winner is </span><span style="color: #ff6600;">Magento</span></i></b></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><b>Ease of use </b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-15670 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-3.png" alt="ease-of-use" width="595" height="238" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-3.png 500w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-3-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" /></h4>
<h4><b>&#8211; Magento </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to Magento, it has a high learning curve. One cannot maintain a website on this platform without getting a developers’ help or hosting service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avail the benefit of the Magento platform you should have the knowledge of cloud hosting, PHP, and HTML  or you can <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-ecommerce-developers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=ecommerce-15659-d7&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>hire eCommerce developers</strong></a> otherwise it would be very difficult for you to run the website on Magento. </span></p>
<h4><b>&#8211; Shopify </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Shopify, I would definitely say it requires no prior skills of website development and coding. The platforms offer hosting and the software itself which means the consumers only need to design, manage and set up the store for which themes and plugins are available. </span></p>
<h4><b>&#8211; WooCommerce </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if you are comfortable with the free version of WooCommerce themes and plugins then it is great for you. But, as I have seen, in the majority of cases, you will definitely need some customizations, after which WooCommerce will become tricky, mainly when you have no coding literacy. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><b><i><span style="color: #008000;">So the winner is</span> <span style="color: #ff6600;">Shopify</span></i></b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, after seeing the detailed explanation of Shopify vs. Magento, Magento vs. WooCommerce, and WooCommerce vs. Shopify, let’s check out their advantages.</span></p>

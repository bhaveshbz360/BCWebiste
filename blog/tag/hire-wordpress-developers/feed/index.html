										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 2021, retail eCommerce sales amounted to approximately 4.9 trillion U.S. dollars globally. This figure is expected to grow by 50 percent over the next four years, reaching about 7.4 trillion dollars by 2025. With platforms like WordPress and Shopify, today it is easier for businesses to create an online store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress has long been the leading platform for starting a website, while Shopify is well known as an easy way to set up an online store and start selling products or services immediately. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many great reasons to choose either of these platforms, but they come with pros &amp; cons that you should consider while deciding which way to go. </span>WordPress vs. Shopify,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is best for your business? In this blog, we will compare both‌, so you can determine which will be right for your requirement.</span></p>
<h2>wQuick Overview</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify and WordPress are two of the most popular eCommerce platforms on the web. When choosing which platform to use for your site, it&#8217;s important to weigh factors such as cost, scalability, and design focus. Let&#8217;s inspect and compare </span>WordPress vs. Shopify<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help you make an informed decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress &amp; Shopify offer free plans available to users, but they differ in functionality. While you can build an online store on both platforms, WordPress is geared more towards bloggers and website owners than those looking to launch an online store. You&#8217;ll need to use a theme designed for eCommerce if you want your site to sell products or services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms can create your website, but WordPress is the more versatile option. It&#8217;s free to download, easy to install &amp; edit yourself, and there are many plugins (like WooCommerce) that you can use to build an online store.</span> <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/top-wordpress-development-services-company-india?utm_source=Organic+-+ValueCoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">WordPress Website Services Company</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will guide you through setting up a business page with great content and then implement Search Engine Optimization techniques to rank it on search engines for the specific product or service you offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Shopify is a turnkey solution. It&#8217;s not free, but you don&#8217;t have to do anything other than plug in your content to get your store up and to run. It has many add-ons and partners that care for things like marketing, design, and customer service. It means you&#8217;re paying a monthly fee and won&#8217;t be able to control every element of your business like with WordPress.</span></p>

You&#8217;ll need to download and install the software on your web hosting. Once you have a hosting account and the installation is complete, you&#8217;ll be able to log in to your dashboard. Here, you will find all of your WordPress settings. You&#8217;ll be able to upload themes from here, manage plugins and build a network of users who can log into your site and edit content without breaking anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In WordPress, a theme controls your website&#8217;s design. Once you&#8217;ve logged into your dashboard, you&#8217;ll be able to upload a new theme and customize its settings by changing background images, uploading custom header graphics, and inputting text into content areas. These themes come with unique features, such as sidebars that can be managed within specific post types to include different ads or calls-to-action throughout different posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, WordPress is entirely open-source. You can download the program to your computer and run it there (or on a hosting provider). You&#8217;ll pay just a one-time license fee and, most times, nothing to host it. Plus, if you&#8217;re working with a theme from outside the WordPress store (like from somewhere like ThemeForest), you&#8217;ll need to install the theme manually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes about ten minutes for anyone who knows what they&#8217;re doing; some of that time is just connecting files properly. Setup and hosting in WordPress are free, but you must deal with updates. Themes are also free in most cases, but you&#8217;ll have to handle updates yourself. And when you want an add-on like WooCommerce for selling goods online, you&#8217;ll need to purchase that.</span></p>

<h3>Shopify</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One important aspect to remember when comparing </span>WordPress vs Shopify <span style="font-weight: 400;">is that a hosting service is required to run WordPress. Shopify provides both hosting and a customizable storefront. If you own an eCommerce website, using one service that manages everything makes sense to spend more time building your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hosting in Shopify also includes security features like firewalls and malware scanning, unlimited bandwidth, storage space, and data transfer. With a hosted site on Shopify&#8217;s platform, you get automatic backups each day, which means if something happens to your site, there will be a copy stored offsite just waiting for restoration! No need to worry about manually backing up files or managing your server&#8217;s storage space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your business needs will dictate what platform would work best for you. It is worth considering the traffic your site generates, how frequently content updates are needed, whether you have technical skills, and how much control over design and branding you want to have before making a decision. </span></p>

<h2><strong>Security &amp; Support In WordPress &amp; Shopify </strong></h2>
<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another important consideration is the site&#8217;s security. WordPress sites are typically more secure than those running on other platforms because over 50% of the internet&#8217;s websites use the platform. Plus, as a self-hosted platform, WordPress has a stronger safety net since you can update it as needed. And if something goes wrong on your WordPress site, you&#8217;re equipped with tools to diagnose and fix it quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With WordPress, you can use free and open-source software, although your site will not be hosted on a secure server unless you upgrade to a paid plan. If you want more options for customization and support, then it’s best to Hire WordPress Developers to  build your online store. It’s important to consider WordPress hosting cost, too; it might prove difficult if you don’t have a developer who can set up all of these components.</span></p>
<h3>Shopify</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is also an issue with both WordPress and Shopify. While it’s not unheard of to be hacked, many security breaches happen due to mistakes made by those running a website, such as installing third-party plug-ins that introduce vulnerabilities into your site or failing to keep your software up-to-date. It is essential to keep everything up-to-date at all times. If you are not sure how to do it yourself, then consider hiring someone who does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shopify, your data is encrypted through SSL and hosted on the fast and secure Amazon Web Services platform, making your website secure. You get more control over your content because you don&#8217;t have to edit the code to make changes on your site- an important aspect that may save time and headaches in the long run. If a technical issue arises with your website, help is available 24/7 to resolve any problems.</span></p>
<h2><strong>WordPress &amp; Shopify: Price Comparison </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an open-source content management system, WordPress costs nothing . You can set up a free website and blog within minutes.  It has four level plans, Personal, Premium, Business, and eCommerce, that help you grow your business with the help of an error-free website. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26791" title="WordPress Latest Price" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price.png" alt="WordPress Latest Price" height="844" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price.png 1700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-300x149.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-1024x508.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-768x381.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WordPress-Latest-Price-1536x763.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px" /> WordPress Latest Price</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://wordpress.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Image Source</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify offers four levels of monthly plans: Starter, Shopify, Advanced, and Shopifyplus for enterprise-grade solutions. The first two are the least expensive. The advanced plan includes 24 hours of support.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26792" title="Shopify Latest Price" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price.png" alt="Shopify Latest Price" height="654" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price.png 1599w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-300x123.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-1024x419.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-768x314.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shopify-Latest-Price-1536x628.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1599px) 100vw, 1599px" /> Shopify Latest Price</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.shopify.com/in/pricing?term=shopify%20plans&amp;adid=566070193615&amp;campaignid=15433369407&amp;branded_enterprise=1&amp;BOID=brand&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1ICZBhAzEiwAFfvFhMu_-1mfLa7HWPWC-NM5yezXQkW2relnHIWNNidEYhQpsrJQF0WkhRoCIIgQAvD_BwE&amp;cmadid=516585705;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494758;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Image Source</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a more cost-effective option, consider Shopify. You won’t get live customer support with a standard account, but you do have access to their large knowledge base. For $14 per month on a basic plan or $29 per month on an unlimited plan, you can have your domain name and website with ease of use, similar to WordPress.</span></p>
<h2>Help &amp; Support</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is also an issue with both WordPress and Shopify. While it’s not unheard of to be hacked, many security breaches happen due to mistakes running a website, such as installing third-party plug-ins that introduce vulnerabilities into your site or failing to keep your software up-to-date. It is crucial  to keep everything up-to-date at all times. If you aren’t sure how to do it yourself, then consider hiring someone who does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Shopify, your data is encrypted through SSL and hosted on the fast and secure Amazon Web Services platform. This makes your website more secure than if you used WordPress. Additionally, you have more control over your content because you don&#8217;t have to edit the code to make changes on your site- an important aspect that may save time and headaches in the long run. If a technical issue arises with your website, help is available 24/7 to resolve any problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, WordPress is just as important to install reliable plugins and keep them updated. Instead of paying monthly fees, </span>WordPress Website Services Company <span style="font-weight: 400;">charges per hour, which can add up quickly depending on the complexity of your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WordPress security and support offers three layers of protection against hackers &#8211; file system level security, brute force login protection, and firewall protection from denial of service attacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will always have access to online resources (forums) to solve problems without paying monthly hosting fees. You will never need to bother about downtime as every hosting provider provides a 99% uptime guarantee, but you should take steps to protect your site with a backup plan before launching, so there are no surprises if something goes wrong.</span></p>
<h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to SEO, there are some differences in terms of technology and focus. WordPress is a blogging platform primarily built around optimizing content for Google. In contrast, Shopify is designed primarily as an eCommerce store builder, so while they have options for creating content like blogs and galleries within their site, their focus is mostly on providing the best experience possible for shoppers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms offer integrations with platforms like Google shopping ads or Facebook ads. But since each has a different design philosophy, these integrations might not work the same way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both platforms can build online stores, each allows you to host and share your content. So if you are struggling to decide on </span>WordPress Vs Shopify, <span style="font-weight: 400;">consider your requirements; you may need to determine where you are currently in your blogging journey.</span></p>

<h2>Market Tools &amp; Features</h2>
<p>In comparing WordPress vs Shopify, now let&#8217;s look at the market tools and features of each platform. Both offer unique tools &amp; features that might or might not meet your business requirement. For a better understanding, let us look at the features of both platforms and decide which one best suits your business:</p>
<h3>Shopify:</h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can start the online store without investing much money, which is good news if you are running on a shoestring budget. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can have your store functioning in minutes using what’s known as a theme. It’s a website template designed to be easy to install. It  will save you work hours because all you have to do is add content, images, and prices. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopify doesn&#8217;t offer a lot of integrations. It offers apps from Google and Facebook so that you can sync your social media accounts with your storefront.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that need more than just those two integrations (like MailChimp) might want to consider another provider like Bigcommerce or Squarespace.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms allow customers to buy anything from physical goods to digital products.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>WordPress:</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress is open-source and available to download for free, so if you’re interested in using it to power your website, you can do so without having to pay a dime or commit any money upfront.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress also has an active community of developers and bloggers who are always updating the platform with new features and improvements on the go, which means that the software will never grow outdated over time.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There is no shortage of plugins compatible with the core WordPress program, as well as a variety of other third-party products that help automate everything from SEO management to shipping logistics.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WordPress is best suited for individuals with little to no programming experience who want a free way to manage their online store. On the flip side, those looking for more advanced features should look into Shopify instead.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Themes are essential when designing a professional-looking website. WordPress offers a range of pre-made themes (free and paid), but there are still not quite as many options available compared to Shopify.</span></li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A single-page website is also called a parallax scrolling website. This kind of website enables the user to scroll through the content of the entire page. On these websites, you do not have to click on different pages to find different types of information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, on a one-page website, you can find sectional content which is clearly explained to the user. The layout of the single-page website is image-driven and mobile-friendly, making the user experience relatively simpler.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Therefore, let&#8217;s discuss the advantages of a single-page website and how can it be useful for your business-</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Advantages of Single Page website<br />
</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main concern with single-page websites is that they cannot incorporate larger websites with a higher requirement of web pages. Single-page websites are easy to develop and require lesser resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, there are bigger companies as well, who prefer single-page websites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="width: 100%; float: left; margin-bottom: 10px;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Single-page-websites.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3775 size-large" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Single-page-websites-1024x608.jpg" alt="advantages Single page website " width="640" height="380" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Single-page-websites-1024x608.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Single-page-websites-300x178.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Single-page-websites.jpg 1667w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Here are some key advantages of a single page website:</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b> 1) Refresh Page is Not There</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-page websites do not have a refresh page feature, which makes the site very user-friendly. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way, the maintenance of the site becomes easier as well.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">2) Load Speed</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-4684" style="margin-bottom: 20px;" title="advantages of single page website " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/load-time-of-single-page-website.png" alt="advantages of single page website load time" width="640" height="288" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/load-time-of-single-page-website.png 615w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/load-time-of-single-page-website-300x135.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/load-time-of-single-page-website-150x68.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important website features for mobile users is load speed. Since the inbound links are linked to a single page the PR of the site automatically goes up, more and more internet users prefer a single-page website than a normal one.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">4) Simplified Storytelling</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-page websites enable simplified brand storytelling.  Websites with numerous pages have complicated navigation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a single-page website, one can scroll through and understand everything about the products and services. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guesswork on the part of the user becomes less, and he can easily find what he is looking for. Adding interactive elements makes the site even more user-friendly.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">5) Better Conversions</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main objective of any website is to generate leads. Being a simple and user-friendly design, single-page websites helps in easier and faster conversion. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the less load time of the single-page website helps in getting a higher number of conversions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-4687" style="margin-bottom: 20px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conversion-rate-single-page-website-1.png" alt="advantages of single page website conversion-rate" width="640" height="362" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conversion-rate-single-page-website-1.png 611w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conversion-rate-single-page-website-1-300x170.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/conversion-rate-single-page-website-1-150x85.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">6) Making Changes To The Site Is Much Easier</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzing the website on a regular basis is a must to improve traffic and conversions. Using tools like Google Analytics helps in improving site design and content. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process becomes simpler with single-page websites, as compared to multipage ones.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">7) Bounce Rate Reduction</b></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps in improving the overall traffic and conversions on the site. If one single-page website in such a way that it fulfills the needs and requirements of the users, the bounce rate would automatically reduce.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">8) Works Well Across Devices</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-page scroll websites are easy to use across devices. These sorts of websites can be easily used across platforms and devices. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user experience, across devices, is uniform and simple. Single-page websites provide a more intuitive user experience to the users.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">9) Cost-Effective</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best features of a single-page website, that makes it stand out, is cost-effectiveness. These websites are simple to develop and manage and can be maintained with a fewer number of resources. </span></p>

<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10) Hassle free surfing</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you have a single page on your website, your users will never be confused, or he doesn&#8217;t need to remember where he found the last interesting content. A single page gives you a simple flow containing every valuable content, making it easier to navigate.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disadvantages</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key disadvantages of single-page websites is that it is very uncommon. This may come as a surprise to the user.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>WordPress 5.5 “Eckstine”</strong> was unveiled on 11th August. This is one of the biggest enhancement endeavours of the WordPress development team, to infuse features that can make WordPress the best web development framework. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, this endeavour of the company is dedicated to <strong>&#8220;Eckstine&#8221;</strong> which includes the most notable changes in the core of WordPress. It is the second WordPress release of the year that includes various incredible feature launches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Let&#8217;s take an in-depth look at the features and functionalities of WordPress 5.5.</strong> </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-14670 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp4.jpg" alt="wordpress 5.5" width="891" height="478" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp4.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp4-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wp4-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Img Src: themeum.com</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, these patterns are predefined layouts for creating blocks in design that allows users to include complex structures of nested blocks on their web pages.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, they allow you to edit your web page in blocks which is another perk of this feature.</span></p>
<h3><b>New UI Design </b></h3>

Many of the changes will have been infused in the core of WordPress, so if you launch the block editor, you will experience a significant change that will drive your amusement. </span></p>

<h3><b>New Block Directory </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new block directory allows you to find, install and third party blocks from the block inserter, just via searching for a block on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plugin directory prompts you to a list of plugins, that allows you to pick &#8220;block plugins&#8221; and insert them to your editor simply. Altogether, it allows you to get a third-party block from the WordPress community, which is an awesome feature to use in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only this, but you can craft your own blocks and publish them into your own directory, which makes it a valuable web <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/10-top-web-development-frameworks-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>development framework. </strong></a></span></p>
<h3><b>Inline Image Editing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image editing is a major issue that developers face while creating any web page. While the image is the major part of each web page.

<h3><strong>Problem: Lack of trust in the quality of work</strong></h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges when outsourcing to India is a lack of trust in the quality of work. This can be a valid concern, as outsourcing often means handing over critical tasks to an external team with whom you have limited control or visibility. However, this does not mean outsourcing to India is inherently risky or unreliable.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose reputable </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-outsourcing-services-company?utm_source=30773+-+why-business-do-not-outsource-to-india&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software outsourcing services</a> with a proven track record of delivering high-quality work. Look for vendors with industry certifications, positive customer reviews, and a strong reputation in the market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Establish clear communication channels and set quality control measures that align with your business objectives. This could include regular progress reports, periodic quality assessments, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure performance.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Build a culture of trust and accountability. This means being transparent about your expectations, providing constructive feedback, and celebrating successes.</li>
<li>Invest and <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/dedicated-development-teams?utm_source=30773+-+why-business-do-not-outsource-to-india&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire dedicated software development teams</a> that provide training and upskilling opportunities that align with your business needs.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At ValueCoders, we understand the importance of quality and trust. That&#8217;s why we have robust quality control processes, including </span>regular audits, performance metrics, and feedback loops. We also heavily invest in our team&#8217;s training and development to ensure they have the skills and expertise to deliver high-quality work. With years of experience in software development and a team of over 450 talented developers, we have the expertise and resources to help businesses overcome their outsourcing challenges and achieve their goals.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use the most recent technologies to provide our clients cutting-edge solutions, including AI, machine learning, blockchain, and others.

<h3><strong>Problem: Communication barriers</strong></h3>
<p>Another common outsourcing issue that businesses face is communication barriers. With teams often working in different time zones and speaking different languages, miscommunication and misunderstandings may occur, leading to errors, delays, and project failure.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish clear communication channels and protocols, including expectations for response times, communication frequency, and preferred communication method.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use technology to facilitate communication, such as video conferencing, chat, and screen-sharing tools like Zoom, Slack, or Microsoft Teams.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish a common communication language to ensure all team members can communicate effectively.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build cultural awareness and sensitivity into your communication protocols to overcome cultural differences.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At ValueCoders, we recognize the critical role that communication plays in </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services?utm_source=30773+-+why-business-do-not-outsource-to-india&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">IT outsourcing services</a>. That&#8217;s why we have a dedicated team of project managers and communication specialists who work closely with our clients to establish clear communication channels and protocols.

<hr />
<h3><strong>Problem: Time-zone differences</strong></h3>
<p>Another significant challenge businesses may face with Indian outsourcing companies is the time zone difference. With India being several hours ahead or behind many other countries, it can be challenging to schedule meetings and ensure that all team members work together effectively. Time zone differences can lead to delays in communication, missed deadlines, and project delays.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish precise schedules and timelines that take into account the time zone difference.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner with </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-consulting?utm_source=30773+-+why-business-do-not-outsource-to-india&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software consulting services</a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">companies that use collaboration tools and technologies like Trello, Asana, and JIRA to manage projects and keep track of progress across different time zones.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule check-ins and status updates regularly to ensure all team members are up-to-date and working together effectively.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner with a company with developers working in shifts, such as ValueCoders, to ensure you can connect anytime.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At ValueCoders, we understand the importance of time zone differences in outsourcing. That&#8217;s why we have multiple locations worldwide, allowing us to provide 24/7 support and ensure that projects stay on track, regardless of the time zone. We use collaboration tools and technologies like </span>Asana, JIRA, and Trello to manage projects and keep track of progress across different time zones. Our project managers and their teams work closely with clients to establish precise schedules and timelines, ensuring that projects are delivered on time and within budget.</p>

<h3><strong>Problem: Cultural differences</strong></h3>
<p>Another outsourcing to India problem that businesses may face is cultural differences. India has a diverse culture, with a different approach to communication, work, and problem-solving than many Western countries. These differences can create misunderstandings, lead to miscommunication, and affect the project&#8217;s overall success.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educate the outsourcing team about the client&#8217;s culture and working style.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish clear communication channels and protocols to avoid misunderstandings.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage regular feedback and check-ins to address any cultural differences that arise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use collaboration tools and technologies like video conferencing, instant messaging, and screen sharing to facilitate communication and understanding.</span></li>
<li>Consider outsourcing <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-services-company?utm_source=30773+-+why-business-do-not-outsource-to-india&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">offshore software development services</a> to a partner with experience working with clients from different cultural backgrounds, like ValueCoders.</li>

<p>At ValueCoders, we recognize the importance of cultural sensitivity in outsourcing. Our team of experts has experience working with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds, allowing us to understand their unique needs and working styles. We use collaboration tools and technologies like instant messaging, video conferencing, and screen sharing to facilitate communication and understanding between our team and clients.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome cultural differences, we regularly give feedback and check-ins, ensuring that the project continues and that our clients are happy with the results.

At ValueCoders, we&#8217;re committed to delivering top-notch software solutions that meet our clients&#8217; unique business needs, regardless of their cultural backgrounds.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Problem: Security concerns</strong></h3>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of shared information, companies may have security issues while outsourcing to India. Concerns about intellectual property theft, data breaches, and other cybersecurity risks could harm the business.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement strict security protocols and measures to protect sensitive information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure all employees and contractors sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) and undergo a comprehensive background check before accessing sensitive information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employ encrypted email, VPNs, and safe file-sharing services as secure communication and collaboration tools.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To identify and stop security breaches, you should routinely monitor and audit the outsourced team&#8217;s access to critical data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider outsourcing to a partner with a strong security and compliance track record, such as ValueCoders.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By outsourcing to </span>offshore consultants in India <span style="font-weight: 400;">like ValueCoders, who have a strong security and compliance track record, businesses can rest assured that their sensitive information is safe.

<h3><strong>Problem: Legal issues</strong></h3>
<p>When outsourcing to India, businesses may face legal issues such as violation of intellectual property rights, breach of contract, and non-compliance with local laws and regulations. These legal issues can lead to costly litigation and damage the business&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent ambiguity or misunderstanding, make sure that legal professionals thoroughly design and evaluate all contracts and agreements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure the outsourcing partner complies with all relevant rules and regulations by performing extensive due diligence on them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add in the contract language that addresses legal concerns and details the remedies that may be used in the event of a violation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use technology and tools for project management to enable real-time project progress tracking and ensure deadlines are fulfilled, lowering the likelihood of disagreements and legal concerns.</span></li>
<li>Work with reputable Indian outsourcing companies with a strong track record of legal compliance, such as ValueCoders.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Benefits of Outsourcing to India</strong><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-30781 aligncenter" title="Benefits of Outsourcing to India" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Benefits-of-Outsourcing-to-India.jpg" alt="Benefits of Outsourcing to India" width="684" height="513" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Benefits-of-Outsourcing-to-India.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Benefits-of-Outsourcing-to-India-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Benefits-of-Outsourcing-to-India-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses aiming to simplify processes, save costs, and boost efficiency can profit significantly from outsourcing to India. Some of the main advantages are as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cost savings:</b> <b>Indian outsourcing companies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can significantly reduce labor costs, as labor is much cheaper in India compared to other countries. According to a study by </span><a href="https://community.nasscom.in/communities/productstartups/why-businesses-hire-indian-companies-software-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NASSCOM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, outsourcing to India can save businesses up to 80% in operational costs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Access to a large talent pool:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Engineers, software developers, and data scientists are just a few of India&#8217;s highly qualified and educated professionals. Businesses now have access to various skills and knowledge they would not otherwise have.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Faster time-to-market:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Using the knowledge and resources of their outsourcing partner, companies may shorten the time to market. Businesses can keep ahead of the competition and react rapidly to shifting market needs with shorter development cycles.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Flexibility:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Businesses can expand or contract their operations as needed. Businesses that want to enter new markets or those whose workloads fluctuate will find this helpful.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2024, millennial customers are going digital. As much as they want to surf the Internet, they like to spend their time on Smartphones too. Hence, as a business owner, it&#8217;s your time to make a stronger online presence for a better brand image.</p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How about building a state-of-the-art website? Or a mobile app to stay one touch away from your customers? </span></em></p>
<p><strong>Seems profitable.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Right? </span></strong></p>
<p>But, before you decide to build your app, take a look at the programming trends that most programmers and <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-it-outsourcing-companies-find-the-best-option-for-your-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">IT outsourcing companies</a></strong> are following in 2024. It will help you get a brief idea about which programming language should be perfect for your project.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This article is continuously updated to help you catch up with the latest programming trends and languages.</span></p>
<h2>11 Top Programming language Trends in 2024</h2>
<p>This year, many programming languages have lost their importance and many other platforms have emerged. But that is the general rule in programming, after all. Everything will keep changing, and the best you could do is adapt. So without further ado, let&#8217;s start with the list of the 11 top language trends this year:</p>
<h2> 1) Python</h2>
<p>Python is really gaining all the buzz these days. This language is widely accepted by data scientists and data analysts, it has also become a very useful language for software engineers, software developers, development leads, managers, engineers, system analysts, and <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-web-app-developers?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=topprogramtrends_6840&amp;utm_campaign=webblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">web developers under the umbrella</a></strong> of software outsourcing companies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9769" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends.png" alt="" width="902" height="361" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends.png 902w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends-600x240.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends-300x120.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends-768x307.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/python-programming-trends-640x256.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></p>
<p>As per the PYPL Popularity of Programming Language report, Python has a 27.34% market share and is considered to be the most popular language as searched for tutorials on Google. Also, it&#8217;s one of the leading languages that set a programming trend in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<h2>2) Java</h2>
<p>Recently Java has become quite less popular than <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/ai-ml/top-programming-languages-to-build-ai-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">other programming languages</a></strong> are, as a result, it has come down to 2nd place in the PYPL (Popularity of Programming Language) list of 2024. At the same time, Java still finds its place at the top of the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">TIOBE index</a> of most popular programming languages of this year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-31863 size-full" title="tiobe programming index" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiobe-programming-index.png" alt="tiobe programming index-2023" width="1221" height="405" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiobe-programming-index.png 1221w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiobe-programming-index-300x100.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiobe-programming-index-1024x340.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiobe-programming-index-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1221px) 100vw, 1221px" /></p>
<p>Java is much faster than before and with fewer lines of code, a feature-rich application can be built. Even the latest version was released back in 2014 still the features are helpful and save costs for businesses.</p>

<h2>3) PHP</h2>
<p>PHP has been here for a long time. Some say PHP is dying. However, PHP is alive and well also still in programming language trends. With PHP&#8217;s latest version, things are different. In the past, PHP was a simple way to build a few dynamic web pages.</p>
<p>If you needed a bit of variety, you could embed simple code between HTML tags. It was basic enough for web developers to embrace it but slow enough to draw sneers from hard-core programmers.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s easy to execute PHP code faster than ever by incorporating the Just-in-Time compiler technology like Java. Now, tools like the HipHop Virtual Machine and PHP are delivering speeds that are twice as fast as the old versions. Though it has lost market share by 5.1% in the last 5 years, it&#8217;s one of the top languages that IT outsourcing companies prefer to build amazing websites.</p>

<h2>4) JavaScript</h2>
<p>According to <strong><a href="https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2018/08/10/language-rankings-6-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">research from Redmonk</a></strong>,  JavaScript is on the top of the list. And obviously why not!! With the newly released Angular 4, upcoming React fiber, fast-growing Vue.js, feature-packed Node.js, and many other <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-javascript-frameworks-list-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">frameworks and libraries</a></strong>, JavaScript is growing really fast and developers of top IT outsourcing Companies are keener to learn this language than ever.</p>
<p>For detailed comparison: <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/vue-vs-react-which-one-to-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Reactjs Vs Vuejs: Which One To Choose?</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-6841 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Top-Programming-languages.png" alt="Top Programming languages" width="744" height="435" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Top-Programming-languages.png 744w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Top-Programming-languages-600x351.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Top-Programming-languages-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></p>
<p>Moreover, with the help of JavaScript MV*, it is much easier to build complicated apps with fewer lines of code and taking less time. These web apps are easily turned into cross-platform mobile apps with the help of PhoneGap, Xamarin, and other technologies, which in turn will get your work done in one attempt. JavaScript has a fourth place in this list for the reason that it is an old language and is already quite common for web development.</p>

<h2> 5) Swift</h2>
<p>When it comes to native <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">mobile app development</a>, Swift is the new sensation for iOS. For years, <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-ios-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">iOS developers</a> were dependent on Objective-C. However, recently Swift has entered the top 10 list of programming languages leaving Objective-C behind and the IT outsourcing companies are adopting it at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>Most <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=topprogramtrends_6840&amp;utm_campaign=webblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">mobile app developers</a></strong> confirm that it is much easier than Objective – C. Although Swift isn’t going to replace Objective-C, however, it gains a lot of attention in 2022. With the release of Swift 5 which offers a host of new, developer-friendly features, this new programming language is certainly to stay in the programming trends.</p>

<h2>6) R</h2>
<p>R is the highly preferred language for a growing number of statisticians, data scientists, data analysts, and other analytical types had been enjoying an incremental rise, moving from 15 to a steady 13 and finally jumping to 12 on Redmonk&#8217;s list. Also, every year its popularity has increased constantly. Although the relevance of Python in related fields has overshadowed the former, R still remains one of the top programming trends of 2022.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9788" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R.png" alt="" width="889" height="377" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R.png 889w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R-600x254.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R-300x127.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R-768x326.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/R-640x271.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" /></p>
<p>This is principally attributable to a softening in its GitHub ranking in the new process. Unlike its competitor in the analytical space, Python, which rose three spots along that axis, R fell five spots in GitHub programming languages rankings even as its Stack Overflow ranking rose one place. This minor movement, however, says little about R’s current or future performance; like PHP, the language remains popular in spite of a step back.</p>
<h2>7) Ruby on Rails</h2>
<p>Ruby on Rails(RoR) is considered to be one of the favorite languages for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-web-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">web developers</a>. Ruby is a funny programming language that makes developers happy at work. Some big brands like Hulu, Airbnb, Basecamp developed their websites with RoR.</p>

<p>Though Ruby has lost its importance a bit, still it is highly preferred by IT outsourcing companies. The latest 5.0 version has many new features and can build web apps faster. As per Redmonk&#8217;s list, Ruby has occupied 7th ranking, and it&#8217;s in the programming trends as well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6881" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruby-Programming-trends.png" alt="Ruby Programming trends" width="817" height="370" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruby-Programming-trends.png 817w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruby-Programming-trends-600x272.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruby-Programming-trends-300x136.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ruby-Programming-trends-768x348.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px" /></p>

<h2>8) Goo</h2>
<h2><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9792" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends.png" alt="" width="860" height="375" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends-600x262.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends-300x131.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends-768x335.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/go-programming-trends-640x279.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></h2>
<p>Go also benefited from the new ranking model, jumping four spots in the GitHub portion of our ranking system, which wasn’t enough to keep up with Swift, which leapfrogged it. To some extent, this isn’t a surprise, as Go had neither the built-in draw of <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ios-application-development-company-india?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=topprogramtrends_6840&amp;utm_campaign=webblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">iOS mobile app development</a></strong> nor is it generally positioned as a front and back end language as Swift increasingly is.</p>
<p>More to the point, while it might have held static, a ranking of 15 in the list of the top programming language trends is impressive for an infrastructure runtime. Hence, many IT outsourcing companies are focusing on this language, and it has set new programming trends among developers.</p>

<h2>9) TypeScript</h2>
<p>Of all the top-tier programming trends in languages, none jumped more than TypeScript on GitHub rankings. While it also saw improvement in its Stack Overflow ranks, it was the GitHub improvement that vaulted it nine spots up and into the Top 20. As Angular is playing a vital role in TypeScript, it can be one of the major factors in rising suddenly.</p>
<p>Also in the PYPL Popularity of Programming Language trends report, it has the 15th rank</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6882" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Typescript-programming-trends.png" alt="Typescript programming trends" width="677" height="261" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Typescript-programming-trends.png 677w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Typescript-programming-trends-600x231.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Typescript-programming-trends-300x116.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /></p>
<h2>10) Kotlin</h2>
<p>Kotlin is rising very quickly these days and changing the programming trends. It&#8217;s holding 19th position in the PYPL Popularity of Programming Language report.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6883" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kotlin-Programming-Trends.png" alt="Kotlin Programming Trends" width="729" height="173" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kotlin-Programming-Trends.png 729w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kotlin-Programming-Trends-600x142.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kotlin-Programming-Trends-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p>There are many reasons for this. The major reason is that Kotlin is now an official language for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/android-app-development-company-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">android app development</a>. In fact, Google itself declared that Android app development will be Kotlin-first at its annual developers&#8217; conference, I/O 2019.</p>

<p>While Kotlin comes with Java on multiple fronts, its ability to both leverage the JVM and interoperate and intermingle with Java code is enormously important. Moreover, it offers top-notch tools and has numerous growing supporters. This is why IT outsourcing companies are getting into this language this year.</p>

<h2>11) Scala</h2>
<p>Scala, a general-purpose programming language, has been designed to be concise and fulfill the shortcomings of Java mostly. Its source code is intended to be compiled to Java byte code to allow the resultant code to run on a Java VM. Also, as its name suggests (Scala is a portmanteau of scalable and language), Scala is designed to grow as one of the top programming trends along with its rise in demand.</p>
<p>Hence, it has a great demand among IT outsourcing companies who know the shortcomings of Java and use it as a replacement. Scala also acquires 11th place on Redmonk&#8217;s list and gets popular every year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years, <strong>Asia</strong> has become one of the most favored outsourcing destinations in India. More and more businesses are preferring to work with Asian outsourcing companies for a various number of reasons. In a recent survey, <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>80% of US and European businesses have listed India as the top outsourcing destination</em></span>.</span> Therefore, some questions arise, “Why do companies outsource to India?” and “Why is India the Hub of Application Development?”.</p>
<p>Even though there are many other countries that have emerged as major competitors, however, IT outsourcing companies in India are the top ones to work with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-40867" title="India is IT Hub" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB.jpeg" alt="India is IT Hub" width="1001" height="650" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB.jpeg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB-300x195.jpeg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB-1024x665.jpeg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB-768x499.jpeg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/freepik-export-20240528064239JLCB-480x312.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px" /></p>
<h2>Reason Why India Is The First Choice For Application Development</h2>
<p>When we started the research at our <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=Blog_al&amp;utm_medium=Indiaforappdev_3933&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">custom software development company</a>, ValueCoders to find out why do companies outsource to India and why is India the hub of application development, we found some of the following favoring reasons:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>India&#8217;s population which is over 1.3 Billion</b></h3>
<p>India is also one of the countries where many people speak English(125 million) compare with other countries in the world. Other than this, India also has the quality of talents which attracts various businesses. Annually, around 3.1 million graduates are added to the workplace.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cost-Effectiveness &amp; </b><b>Quality Services</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cost-effectiveness is one of the main advantages that software development companies in India offer. Flexibility in pricing allows businesses the freedom to manage their budgets and provide them with a huge set of benefits. This pricing factor is the main reason why there is a huge gap that exists between personnel costs in India and that of other developed countries.</p>

With excellent support by the government, Indians are able to build a high-tech IT park which has the best in class technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s government does not change the rules frequently; that&#8217;s why other countries prefer India to avail of application development services. This is the only reason Why is India The Hub of Application Development.</p>

They are experts in their fields and possess in-depth knowledge and extend logics while developing various software. This is the reason why Indian developers are more technologically sound.</p>
<p>The Indian app developers have good knowledge of advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), IoT, Blockchain, Big Data, and more. Nowadays, various business verticals prefer to adopt modern technologies to develop the app, and that&#8217;s why the other countries look for technology-specific developers who build an app at an affordable rate. These all things are possible when you will hire the developers for India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, most tech startups, in fact, enterprises have drifted away from developing new software products in-house. But is it right to stop growth in the face of a disaster such as this?</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the novel coronavirus is as big as a problem as it gets. But the world will eventually come out of it. At that time, would you want your startup to take its time to freshen up and understand the needs of the market? Or would you want to start preparing a great software product so you&#8217;re ready when the market needs it most?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure your choice would be the latter, but most businesses have their hands tied. They&#8217;re unable to operate due to lockdowns, disruption in supply chains, unavailability of staff, and out of myriad problems created by COVID-19. Yet, there are few businesses that are fortunately <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/covid-19-are-we-ready-to-face-this-global-adversity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">working as smooth as ever</a>, especially in the software outsourcing sector.</p>
<p>So if a business (maybe yours) is unable to work on an in-house software project due to COVID-19, is it a wise choice to outsource it to an <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">offshore software development company</a>? Why outsourcing is important? What are the benefits of outsourcing a software development project?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, if you&#8217;re a tech startup in desperate need to capitalize on an opportunity and establish a market presence, then:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1- This isn&#8217;t the best time to run your business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2- Once we&#8217;re done with COVID-19, the state of the market at the time will present unprecedented opportunities that startups could capitalize on. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the same time, your startup could be competing with 100s of established enterprises looking to capitalize on the same opportunities.</span></p>
<p>Is there something you could to have an edge over potential competitors in such a scenario?<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong> Product Development Outsourcing</strong></a> could be the masterstroke for a competitive advantage in the long-run. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-3822 size-full aligncenter" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg" alt="outsourcing product development" width="800" height="628" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development-300x236.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you may know, there are multiple options available in the market to build functional software products. However, when it comes to startups, there&#8217;s a conventional line of thought which says that the benefits of outsourcing are for enterprises only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you can certainly outsource product development as a startup and this is important to your business as well, especially in this pandemic situation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Benefits of Outsourcing</strong><br />

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing provides a global talent pool at a low cost. You hire a backend developer (in-house) at  98000 USD/year and it comes down to 22000 USD/year when you outsource.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The risk is lesser</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of new products whose market is yet to be tested, outsourcing plays an important role in mitigating the risks of trying out something new. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Since the outsourced teams work on flexible models the risks are definitely lower.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>It&#8217;s Faster</strong></span></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You may be new to the market. That&#8217;s not an issue until you have technical expertise with you. If you already have that, then it&#8217;s good, however, if you don&#8217;t- then it is better to outsource.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>key steps for your startup to effectively outsource product development</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b><b>Choose the Right Vendor</b></b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right vendor for outsourcing application development is a must. An <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=blog_al&amp;utm_medium=startup_prodev_3816&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing company with expertise</a></strong> in the required development skills will surely be helpful. Picking up freelancers is definitely not advisable, as they cannot be relied upon, for taking up product ownership. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the important points to consider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while selecting a vendor for outsourcing development is the flexibility of hiring models. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps the startup choose a hiring plan that will optimize the costs of outsourcing in accordance with the development requirements. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important to evaluate the portfolio of the hiring vendor to understand the level of specialization in different business verticals.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Defining The Scope Of The Project</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second most important step in outsourcing your product development is to define the scope of the project. First, you need to convert the business idea into a business plan and then put down what all you need from a successful product. Defining the technology with which you wish to develop your product is another crucial decision. This also helps in defining the skill levels of the teams you wish to hire. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the scope of the project is defined and the vendor for product development has been chosen, the service level agreement with the vendor can be created. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps in ensuring that the outsourced teams are working according to the plan of action. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outsourced teams must be clearly communicated about the expectations and the milestones. This helps in developing mutually beneficial relationships with the outsourcing partner.</span></p>

<h3><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Communication</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping in touch with the outsourcing partner on a regular basis and reviewing project work in progress on a constant basis is important. This is helpful in improving project productivity levels. Motivating remote teams with incentives and appreciation is helpful in getting better business results.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overall, a continuous communication helps you to finish tasks smoothly.</strong></p>

<p class="graf graf--p">As you’d expect, experts in these IT outsourcing companies spend most of their time improving previous techniques and learning new skills and strategies. They can bring world-class knowledge and experience to your company if you outsource the IT project.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This includes proven procedures and processes, documentation, and more structured methodologies. You will also be comforted that your provider will constantly update, patch, and replace systems when necessary.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">8) Risk Management</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Hiring an IT Outsourced Company is a great way to manage your risk if you can’t get any part of your business up and running. If you’re looking to start a new business, outsourcing some or all aspects of your operations can take the pressure off and make it easier for you to run everything else.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Outsourcing companies have experience managing other people’s businesses, so they will know what they are doing when they take over yours. They will be able to find any potential problems that may arise without causing too much disruption to your business.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">9) Growth Opportunities</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Since outsourced companies are invested in their employees, they’ll provide opportunities for them to work on bigger and more important projects. This will lead to increased opportunities for advancement and higher salaries. As a result, everyone wins!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The company benefits from the service provided by talented individuals, the individual benefits from the opportunity for career progression, and the organization as a whole benefits from skilled people vested in making it successful.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">10) Better Retention</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The outsourced company is vested in keeping its employees happy, so they’ll stay with them longer. They’ll also build better relationships because there will be more time for them to get to know each other as a team.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For instance, the freelancer may have different skillset or experience than you are looking for, and it takes more time to train them than just contracting an outside company.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p">4. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Remote Support &amp; Monitoring Services</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Offers remote assistance to troubleshoot technical problems through emails, phone calls, or other electronic means without needing an on-site visit.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">5. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Professional Outsourcing</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">A company hires another company to provide services on its behalf for any part of its organization. Professional outsourcing companies generally perform high-level services, such as accounting and legal work.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">When a company contracts with another firm to manufacture products on its behalf. The manufacturing partner will assemble and take responsibility for design and production in this case.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">7. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Outsourcing</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">R&amp;D outsourcing partners manage all aspects of research, including developing prototypes and getting patents so that one can use them at any time.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">8. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Process Outsourcing</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">It involves assigning entire processes to third parties. For example, process outsourcing could involve managing an entire product development process or handling inventory management.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">9. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Operational Outsourcing</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Employers contract out employees with specific skills or expertise in this type of outsourcing. Employees remain employed by the employer but work under contract for a contractor.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p">10. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Multisourcing</strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Organizations might use over one outsourcer for similar services in multisourcing arrangements. Using multiple outsourcers allows organizations to leverage and combine each partner’s strengths, benefits, or cost profiles.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">Things To Keep In Mind While Hiring An IT Outsourcing Company</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you outsource your business, you buy services from third-party vendors independent of your business. Before making up your mind while hiring an outsourcing company, make sure you have the following points clear in your head:</p>
<ul>
<li class="graf graf--p">Consider the long-term goals of your business.</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">Do you want to do all the work in-house, or would you prefer to outsource some tasks?</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">What are your short-term budget constraints?</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">Is it better for your business to hire a freelancer, contract worker, or full-time employee?</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">Are you looking for an individual with specific skills or a team of experts who can work on multiple projects simultaneously?</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">What is the expected output at the end of the engagement, and how will you measure progress throughout the project?</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">Does your chosen partner offer guarantees or warranties?</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">How much access will you be given to their team, and how will they collaborate with your employees (if any)?</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">So these points will help you decide whether it’s worth the investment to get an outsourcing company working on your business.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In most cases, if you’re unsure about something mentioned above, then just contact the provider and ask them questions about what they think is best for your business!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Whether to hire outsourced staff or not should be taken lightly — but once you’re satisfied with all aspects mentioned above, go ahead and invest in this solution!</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">How To Find the Best IT Outsourcing Company</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">When looking for an IT outsourcing company, there are many things you need to consider. There are a few questions to ask yourself when determining the best service provider for your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li class="graf graf--p">What is your budget?</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">Who will be managing the outsourced team?</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">What kind of expertise do you need?</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">Do you have any industry-specific requirements?</li>
<li class="graf graf--p">How much does quality matter to you?</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">The outsourcing company should answer these questions and provide a cost estimate upfront. They can give you a ballpark figure to help you better understand the market.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It’s important to get references from past clients to know what to expect when you work with them. Please remember that prices vary greatly among different providers, so compare bids thoroughly before deciding which company to hire.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">The Cost Efficiency of IT Outsourcing</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">The IT infrastructure is a precious business asset that enables any organization to conduct day-to-day activities and stay competitive. You must invest wisely in your IT infrastructure and ensure it’s properly maintained, with high performance and maximum uptime.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">While the costs of hiring an in-house team are relatively fixed, outsourcing allows companies to pay only for the services they need. The cost of this strategy is determined by the number of hours needed per month by the service provider and whether the customer desires any other features.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Thus, <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">ValueCoders</a> offers many different options so that customers can find one which suits them best.

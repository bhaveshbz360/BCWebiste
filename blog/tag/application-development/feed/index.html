										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development has been around since the early <strong>1980s</strong>. Many businesses have turned to custom and off-the-shelf solutions. It is the best way to solve problems by using custom business logic without spending too much time and money on development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of software development spans centuries, not decades. From the first adding machine to calculate square roots hundreds of years ago, the technology has been advancing. Our civilization has been improving technology in ways previously deemed impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, those hardware and software upgrades brought some great advancements. It includes calculating calendars or even retail applications like letting customers buy things on credit. Moreover, Custom software development has always been a challenge for many companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A custom software project can be complex and time-consuming, which is why it&#8217;s important to have best practices in place to mitigate the risk of failure. So here, know which challenges and risks you can face while custom software development and how you can alleviate the risk with best practices. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Is Custom Software Development?</strong><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-22512  aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/custom-software.jpg" alt="custom software development" width="854" height="477" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/custom-software.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/custom-software-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development is the process of building a custom solution for an organization&#8217;s needs. Customized solutions can come in many different shapes and sizes, such as mobile apps with specific features to fit your company branding or web applications that give customers easy access to their account info no matter where they are on any device.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many organizations choose this method because they are looking for something that&#8217;s not available in the market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development entails much more than just writing code to make an app or website work a certain way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also project management, QA testing, UI design, and branding involved in this process as well. With so many steps involved, it&#8217;s critical to have a solid roadmap in place with predetermined milestones.  </span></p>

<h3><strong>Process of developing custom software application</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>The process of developing a custom software application involves the following steps:</strong></em></p>
<h3><b>Define your needs:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before proceeding with any development or implementation plan, it&#8217;s important to first define your needs. This is the most critical part of any software development effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is because you want to make sure all requirements are clearly identified, documented, and analyzed for feasibility before writing a single line of code or designing screens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will help assure that everyone involved in this project is on the same page when it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comes time to start development work, and it also gives you a clear idea of your end goal. If </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you don&#8217;t take this step; it&#8217;s easy to lose sight of your project goals and get sidetracked by other nonessential features.   </span></p>
<h3><b>Specify the requirements:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once there is a clear understanding of what needs to be done, the next critical decision revolves around deciding how much work should actually go into each requirement before developing any solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you&#8217;ll need to do some careful analysis of requests and determine how they align with the business needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a customer comes up with an idea for a mobile application that can display all their products in one place, so they never have to worry about forgetting what&#8217;s on sale or running out of inventory, then this request is a great use case for some mobile-friendly web application.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just remember not to prioritize requests based on how interesting they are to you but rather on how much they&#8217;ll benefit the company&#8217;s business goals.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all possible features are listed out and sorted with proper priority, then it becomes easier for developers to determine which requests can be completed in less time without compromising their overall project objectives. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/top-and-best-companies/top-5-custom-software-development-companies-offering-bespoke-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Top 25 Custom Software Development Companies Offering Bespoke Solutions</span></a></strong></em></p>
<h3><b>Determine the budget: </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting any development work, it&#8217;s important that everyone involved in this project is informed of the costs that are associated with it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes time, resources, and any additional expenses that might be needed to successfully complete a project. Without having an accurate estimate for how much work will go into each request, you run the risk of overspending on your budget or not being able to deliver features as quickly as you should. </span></p>
<h3><b>Define the scope:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once everyone has an idea about how long it&#8217;s going to take and what things are expected of them, then the next step is defining a clear scope for this project. This means detailing exactly how much work will be done on each request before moving on to other tasks or features that might come up later on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a solid roadmap is in place, it becomes easier for everyone involved to focus their efforts and make sure they&#8217;re spending time on the right tasks at any given moment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Establish milestones:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common practice among project managers when developing custom software applications is establishing short-term goals or checkpoints known as milestones. These are used to monitor progress, finalize requirements and ensure that everything is on track before continuing work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of milestones needed will vary depending on the size and complexity of a project, but they&#8217;re usually set at certain points in order to hit deliverables or key events such as initial development kickoff, launch date, or adding new features. This way, there&#8217;s always a clear idea of what has been achieved and how much work is left until the project is completed. </span></p>
<h3><b>Designing and Development:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the necessary groundwork completed, it&#8217;s time to start designing and developing your <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-development?utm_source=webblogwhitepaper-22511-customapplication&amp;utm_medium=S05" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">custom software application</a>. This is where you&#8217;ll need to make sure you have a solid team of developers who are well-versed in the latest technology trends as well as best practices for efficient development workflows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, in order to form a leading software, it&#8217;s important to use attractive UI/UX design, appropriate programming languages, and technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python are the most preferred programming language for software development.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22514" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22514" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22514 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/languages.png" alt="Programming Languages" width="598" height="489" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/languages.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/languages-300x246.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22514" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                              Image Source:</strong> GoodFirms</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the globe, Linux is one of the most popular software development platforms.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22515" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22515" style="width: 616px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22515 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/popular-software-platform.png" alt="Software Platforms" width="616" height="580" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/popular-software-platform.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/popular-software-platform-300x282.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22515" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                            Image Source:</strong> 99firms</figcaption></figure>
<h3><b>Testing: </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don&#8217;t want to miss one tiny detail during this process. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to test each small piece of the software development chain before moving on and adding more features or functionality. </span></p>
<p>The best way to check whether there is any bug in your app or not. For this, you need to do beta testing, which can be done by asking clients to test the application.</p>
<h3><b>Deployment and Marketing:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deploying your custom software is not less important than any other phase of the development process. If you are deploying an app online, then first create a landing page for that particular app to tell people about it, and on that, insert Google Analytics code so that you can track visitors coming from different sources, i.e., search engines, referrals, etc.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, you need to promote your app and make it popular among the masses. You can do so by putting ads on different Google Adwords platforms or Facebook pages, and so on…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, by taking help from a recognized </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>custom software development company</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can manage all the custom software development processes in a simple and agile way.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Risk and Challenges Involved In Custom Software Development</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development is challenging work that comes with many risks. Like any project, there are always unforeseen circumstances that can happen along the way. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of some common risk factors involved in custom software development:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22516" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22516" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22516 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/challenges.png" alt="Risk and Challenges" width="655" height="570" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/challenges.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/challenges-300x261.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22516" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                           Image Source:</strong> GoodFirms</figcaption></figure>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>You&#8217;re Overly Ambitious</strong> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although you might think your idea is unique, there is a good chance that the features and requirements already exist in </span><b>custom software development </b><b>solutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Without looking into available options before diving headfirst into development, this can lead to wasted time and money when you realize it&#8217;s not what was needed after all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This typically happens with startups where the founder wants to create something that is much more than what they originally intended. </span></p>
<h3><strong>The Solution Is Not Solved</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&#8217;re working with custom software development, there&#8217;s always a chance that the solution isn&#8217;t solved in such a way that it&#8217;ll actually benefit the company moving forward. This could be because requirements were misunderstood or not well thought out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without making sure that the solution fits into your business model, it might not be worth all of the time and energy you put into development, to begin with.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Project Don&#8217;t Have Purpose</strong></h3>
<p>Without a clear purpose for the software you&#8217;re creating, it&#8217;s likely that your project will be abandoned. It may get limited in some way. Without having a solid goal to work towards, there is no direction. In fact, nobody can determine if they are reaching success because things like ROI cannot be calculated.</p>
<h3><strong>Poor Reach and Communication</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most projects need a team of people working together to make sure everything is completed as it should. There should be proper reach and communication from the team. Without this, things can slip through the cracks or not be done as they were intended. It ultimately leads to frustration on all ends. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Inaccurate Development Estimates</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to custom software development, most projects are done on an Agile or Waterfall model. These models require accurate estimates of the time and resources needed for each step in order to avoid going over-budgeted hours and having a team sitting around waiting to move forward with other parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Without planning properly and accurately estimating, you&#8217;re likely to see a lot of wasted time. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22517" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22517" style="width: 812px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22517 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reasons.png" alt="Estimates" width="812" height="387" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reasons.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reasons-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22517" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                                 Image Source:</strong> 99Firms</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>How To Alleviate The Risk Of Failure With Best Practices?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to avoid failure is by doing your research. You must know what you&#8217;re getting into before developing the software. This will help weed out any bad ideas or projects that are not feasible at the beginning of a custom development project.  </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Here&#8217;s how to reduce risks and challenges:</em></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Start with an MVP</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must start with an MVP (minimum viable product) if you want to reduce the risk of failure. Also, make sure you&#8217;re getting one that&#8217;s proven. This is a critical step in mitigating your risks early on while still allowing room for changes if needed.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Start Small</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to mitigate challenges during custom software development is by starting small and then expanding. This way, if something goes wrong with any step of the process, you can just go back to the previous stage and fix it instead of having to start all over again. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Prioritize</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another best practice is prioritizing your project in order to make sure everything gets done on time while minimizing risk. Make a list for every task, and then determine the order in which you want to do them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these best practices, you can reduce your risks of failure when custom software development is involved. Customizing a solution for your business needs may be complex and time-consuming, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be risky if you&#8217;re aware of all possible challenges ahead of time.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Communicate Frequently</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development requires a lot of communication between you and your developers. To reduce risks, make sure to communicate frequently about what&#8217;s going on with the project so there are no surprises later down the road or misunderstandings that can cause delays.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Technical Risk Mitigation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to custom software development, there are many variables that can cause challenges. </span>Technical risks include things like whether or not the code is maintainable and reusable for future projects. Moreover, this can be a case if all requirements have been met by everyone involved in the project.</p>
<p>There are also organizational risk factors such as a lack of communication between your team members. However, it may be if there are too many people working on the project at one time.</p>
<p>By following these risk mitigation best practices, you can avoid many of the major risks and challenges. This usually comes with developing a custom software solution for your business. The more prepared you are ahead of time, the better off you&#8217;ll be on project completion, and this is what a company wants?<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Do you want to create a mobile app, but are you not sure how to get it designed well to attract users?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, a great app experience is a magic ingredient for your app&#8217;s success. Not only does it entice users to visit your application multiple times, but it also makes Android app development hassle-free by defining concise design boundaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are striving to secure an application with a splendid look and feel, you can leverage various UX/UI design strategies that can make your app look hot and sour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will look over some UX/UI design methods for <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/android-app-development-company-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">android app development</a> that can add crispness to your app design and can make it the biggest hit in the year 2020. </span></p>
<h2><b>UX/ UI Design &#8211; The Magic Ingredient </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telling the importance of eloquent user experience design is quite difficult. Though, we can simply understand that UX design strives to fulfill the users’ needs in accordance with the look and feel of the app.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, users’ complete journey on your application depends upon the user experience. This is a simple roadmap that allows you to define the entry and exit of a user on your application. A concise and well-constructed UX /UI design is the major factor for the success of various business applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, UX/UI design is all about how a person feels while interacting with your application. Is he finds it hard to use? Can he navigate through different features and options easily? Well! App design strategies usually consider these questions and aim for a positive impression.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2><b>How to create an incredible UX/UI design for your app? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several things to consider while designing your mobile app. Here are some points that can help to strategize your design practice. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">   </span><b> # Emphasize On App Experience </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An app comprises value when people find it and use it. Thus, engaging the target audience is the most prominent goal, and this you can achieve by creating something that people want to experience. Thus, </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=richandroidapp_13287_rg121&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software outsourcing companies</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> always focus on the app experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern users are looking for more ease and interactivity in apps, thus the use of Augmented reality is gaining significant traction. Making an enjoyable and delightful user experience can boost user app credibility and can steal the eyes. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13309" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="340" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While user experience is all about the users’ perception and interaction with the application. UX design combines visuals, sounds, actions, touch, social stigma, and emotions to create an outstanding user experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is to “give users what they want and a bit additional”. With your application, offer your services effectively and efficiently, while compelling them to think, “Wow, this app is excellent”.</span></p>

<hr />
<h4><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are some points that you must be mindful of</span>: </strong></em></h4>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Never utilize inconsistent and wrong icons for basic functions like Edit, Delete, Share, Send, etc. The basic purpose of every icon must be defined and clear. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always determine the accuracy and quality of your UI on different devices having indifferent screen sizes. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never stuff the screen with too much content and icons. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always use good quality graphics. Most should have common sizes. </span></li>
</ol>

<hr />
<h3><b># Declutter </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major recommendation in almost every design guide is “declutter”. Decluttering makes your interface look easy and lite. Remember, clutter is the biggest enemy of your app design. Thus, overloading too much information on your app screen can ruin your app look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every icon, image, and button can make the app screen complicated, so choose wisely. Believe me; clutter looks worse on the mobile screen. So, be mindful of decluttering, and follow the given practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13306" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1.png" alt="" width="512" height="270" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /> </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never show too much information to users. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always keep content to a minimum. Focus on users&#8217; needs. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure to keep minimum interface elements. Design simple and make it extremely easy. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive disclosure techniques can be helpful for showing several options. </span></li>
</ol>
<h3><b># Use Modern Design Trends </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the arrival of many new technologies, UX/UI design trends also change. Leveraging design trends can help you stun the people. It will also help in attracting your target audience uniquely. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Day by day Bot usage is increasing. The bot help startups, SMEs and big brands in reaching customers and enhancing customer engagement. If I talk about Twitter Bot, then around </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_bot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15% of twitter is formed of bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter allows you to build a bot, but it enables you to create one bot for a single function means Twitter Bot cannot be created for multiple purposes. Twitter Bot can be built by using</span><b> Python</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but for this, you need to use the</span><b> Tweepy library.</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you might be thinking </span><b>Tweepy,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what is this?? It is a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. Tweepy is best for manageable automation, and building Twitter Bots it holds multiple features.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Do You Know?</b></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/281375/heads-of-state-with-the-most-twitter-followers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, 187 countries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> represented an official presence on Twitter.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the University of Southern California and Indiana University study, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03107.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">48 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Twitter bots are active.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Steps To Build Twitter Bot Using Python</strong><b></b></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s discuss a simple procedure to create Twitter Bot using Python. Follow each of the mentioned steps carefully as then only you will be able to build a Twitter Bot.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>#Step 1: Begin With Making Module</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before working on any project or starting any work, it is mandatory to build the proper plan; this simplifies the development process and also helps you to identify the next step. If you create an adequate project development module, then for you, it will be simple to estimate the bot development time.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to create a Twitter Bot that tweets out, then for that, we need to use Twitter&#8217;s API as this helps in tweet posting. You can also use Git hubs API to obtain the post history. After making use of API, you need to write code in Python as this step will stimulate the Twitter Bot development process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Know More: <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-should-startups-opt-chatbot-development-jc32308b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Best Chatbot Development Companies For SME&#8217;s &amp; Startups in India | USA</a></strong></span></p>
<h3><strong># Step 2:  Assembling Materials and Building Structure</strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly find out the materials which you want to use in Twitter Bot development as this will make the material assembling process more manageable. I have used </span><b><i>Twitter_bot.py</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as my first file. This file has four main parts, and this includes</span> <b><i>Imports</i></b><b><i>, </i></b><b><i>APIs Keys</i></b><b><i>, </i></b><b><i>Authentication</i></b><b><i>, </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span> <b><i>Code</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How To Get API Keys? </strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to create an account on Twitter developer platform as this will only help you in getting the API Keys for developing Twitter Bot. If you don&#8217;t know how to create an account on Twitter developer platform, then just follow the process mentioned below. </span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly open the </span><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter developer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then from the Twitter developer homepage, click on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> option.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">On clicking the tab, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter Sign In</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page will open. On that page, you need to enter the phone, email, or username and Password. Once after entering all credentials, simply tap the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">login</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tab.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-13789 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter4.png" alt="twitter bot" width="670" height="385" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter4.png 670w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter4-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereafter, another page will get open in that you need to need general information like what the bot is going to do, do you plan on gathering data, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once after entering all the details, another page of terms and policy will get open from there, read all the information, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">check the boxes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and at last tap the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submit Application</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tab.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way, your Twitter developer account will get created. Now just click the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">create an app</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tab, on tapping this option another page of App detail will get open in that simply enter the asked details.</span></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">On choosing the keys and token option, you will get </span><b>Get API Keys.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-13792 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter7.png" alt="twitter bot" width="625" height="249" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter7.png 625w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter7-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way, you can simply get the API Keys. Once after getting the API Keys, you will be able to build a Twitter Bot using Python.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>GitHub APIs</b></h5>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To fetch GitHub APIs is more simple, in comparison to Twitter. To get GitHub APIs, you just need to create an account on it, and then after that, you just need to make a few relevant clicks and taps as on this you will be able to fetch the GitHub API. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If in case you are confronting any sort of issue or having doubt then you can Hire a Python Programmer from the recognized <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software outsourcing company</a> this will help you in developing the full-fledged Twitter Bot.</span></p>
<h3><strong># Step 3: Initiate Bot Writing (Imports, APIs Keys, Authentication, and Code)</strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Imports</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On researching, you will be able to find the relevant API documentation to create the Twitter Bot. Now you need to install Tweepy for creating a bot and for this you can use the </span><b><i>pip install</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> command. Don’t forget to install DateTime to manage this process. The vital part of import is &#8211;  </span><b><i>environ. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary component of your file should look similar to this:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13794" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter7-1.png" alt="twitter bot" width="397" height="163" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter7-1.png 397w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter7-1-300x123.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></p>
<p><b>API’s Key</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin the process firstly, you need to load the keys. For each key make a separate file and then after that set the variable names. Both files naming should be compatible.  To keep keys private, we need to push it to GitHub, and for that, we use a variable environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environment variables enable us to reach the keys without placing them in the code; this is the reason why we imported </span><b><i>environ</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from os back in the import section. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are going to make this Twitter Bot for the public then at that point I will recommend you create a separate</span> <b><i>keys.py</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">file.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b><i>keys.py</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">file should look like this:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13795" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter8.png" alt="" width="453" height="146" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter8.png 453w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter8-300x97.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want that your bot tweet every day then don’t forget to set interval and it can be set by using </span><b><i>60 * 60 * 24</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you should also declare variable </span><b><i>d </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">like this</span><b><i> (cur_date = datetime.today)</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make a bot using the correct date-time object. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the </span><b><i>Twitter_bot.py</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> file will accommodate this section.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13796" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter9.png" alt="twitter bot" width="455" height="223" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter9.png 455w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter9-300x147.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /></p>
<p><b>Substantiation</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you will be able to verify the APIs, and this will finally help the bot in communicating with Twitter. We can use</span> <b><i>api</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span> <b><i>g</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as the variable names for Twitter and GitHub, respectively; this will help you in cutting down the number of keystrokes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can use </span><b><i>api</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span> <b><i>g</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> variables in </span><b>Twitter_bot.py</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On doing variable to</span> <b>Twitter_bot.py,</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it will look like this:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13797" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter10.png" alt="twitter bot" width="544" height="143" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter10.png 544w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter10-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /></p>
<p><b>Code</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For running the program indefinitely, you have to set a </span><b><i>while loop</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equal to </span><b><i>True</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Within the </span><b><i>while loop</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, list down the repos date-time object. For listing down the date-time object in the list first, you have to extract the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After doing this, we can check the current date in the list, after that we can use</span><b><i> if </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><b><i> else</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for managing the tweet post in the Twitter Bot. If you want to track the number of tweet days, then you need to add a count variable to the program; on doing this, every day count will get updated in the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we need to add </span><b><i>time.sleep(INTERVAL)</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outside the loop this will make the function wait for 24 hours until it does it ageing and its code will look like this:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13798" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter11.png" alt="twitter bot" width="610" height="501" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter11.png 610w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter11-300x246.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p><b><i>THAT’S HOW YOUR TWITTER BOT BY USING PYTHON LANGUAGE WILL GET CREATED</i></b></p>

<h2><strong>It’s Time To Make Your Bot More Perfect</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After creating the bot, a process not ends means now you need to make your Twitter Bot more perfect, this will help your business in generating more customer leads. It is really easy to build a basic bot, but when it comes to perfection, then even experts face the issue, in that case, you can Hire Python developer from a Software outsourcing company.  </span></p>
<p><b>Trafficking With Error</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some time, Twitter does not allow users to post the same tweet, and if you do this again and again, then it will ultimately display an error. This problem can be rectified by using</span> <b><i>if else</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">statements. If you want to avoid this error message then you can use this sort code:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13799" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter12.png" alt="twitter bot" width="512" height="291" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter12.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twitter12-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><b>Stop Running This Program Continuously On your Computer</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to stop running this program on your computer, then you can push this program to Cloud like Heroku. This will protect your program when the computer loses internet connectivity. It is not possible to turn on your computer all the time as this somewhere affects the computer functionalities. It will be beneficial if you upload your bot program on Cloud as this safe your data and will also protect the Twitter Bot program from other bugs and errors.</span></p>
<p><b>Test Twitter Bot</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completion of the whole development process don&#8217;t forget to test the Bot functioning. If all the functions are running perfectly then, it means your Twitter bot is all set, and now it can be used for business tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If while testing you are facing any sort of glitch then try to resolve the same, and if in case you are unable to fix the same then you can also take help from experts, but for that, you need to Hire Python developer. For hiring, developers do choose the best software development company as this will help you in enhancing the bot performance.</span></p>

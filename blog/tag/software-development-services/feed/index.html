<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s begin by understanding what exactly Agile software development is and how adopting Agile principles can significantly reduce time to market, give businesses a competitive edge, and reduce time to market to drive success.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Agile Software Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile methodology is defined as the popular approach in the field of software development that mainly focuses on collaboration, flexibility, and customer-centricity. It focuses on iterative progress through small, manageable increments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/on-demand-teams/why-startups-choose-dedicated-teams-for-agile-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">dedicated Agile teams</a></strong> to adapt to changing requirements &amp; deliver value to customers more quickly &amp; efficiently.</span></p>
<h3><b>Key Principles &amp; Values of Agile</b><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-41126" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile.png" alt="Key Principles &amp; Values of Agile" width="748" height="397" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-300x159.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-768x407.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the list of key principles involved in Agile software development:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Iterative Development:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Agile methodology promotes breaking down the software development process into smaller i.e. iterative sprints or iterations. Each iteration involves designing, planning, developing, and testing a small functionality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Collaboration: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Agile&#8217;s core values is fostering close collaboration among cross-functional teams. Developers, testers, designers, and stakeholders work together during the entire project. They also ensure everyone is aligned &amp; contribute expertise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile teams often adjust their plans quickly and priorities as project requirements evolve based on customer feedback or market changes. This type of flexibility helps respond to new insights without disrupting the overall project flow.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Focus on Customers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Agile emphasizes delivering value to the customer. Agile teams also ensure that the final software product meets users&#8217; needs &amp;expectations. This iterative feedback loop helps refine features and functionalities based on real-world usage and feedback.</span></li>

<h3><b>Comparison with Traditional Software Development Methods</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By comparing Agile approach with other traditional methods, it will become clear how Agile&#8217;s adaptive &amp; responsive nature can accelerate time to market. This will ensure that the software effectively meets user needs &amp; market demands.</span></p>
<p><b>1. <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/agile-vs-waterfall-which-software-methodology-is-best-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Agile vs Waterfall</a>:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional software development methods i.e. the Waterfall model, follow a linear &amp; sequential approach. Each phase (in terms of requirements, design, development, testing, and rapid deployment) must be completed before moving towards the next. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This further leads to long development cycles and challenges accommodating changes once a phase is completed.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Predictability vs. Flexibility:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">While traditional methods offer predictability &amp; structured planning, they often lack the flexibility to adapt to these changes. Conversely, Agile embraces change &amp; uncertainty. This allows teams to pivot and make adjustments as needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes Agile particularly well-suited for projects with evolving requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Feedback Cycles:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In traditional methods, feedback typically comes late in the process, often during the testing phase or after deployment. Agile incorporates regular feedback throughout the development cycle, enabling continuous improvement and early identification of issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reduces the risk of major problems emerging late in the project.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Importance of Time to Market for Businesses</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a flexible framework, <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>custom mobile app development</strong></a> software can scale alongside the growth of a business. Custom software can handle more users, transactions, or data without slowing down. This means it stays strong and dependable even as the business grows, laying a solid foundation for long-term success.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Enhanced Flexibility for Agility</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software lets businesses change and grow as per the market. They can add, change, or remove features easily, keeping up with what customers want. This flexibility helps businesses grab new opportunities and change their strategies quickly, staying innovative and competitive.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Seamless Integration with Existing Systems</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software fits smoothly with other systems of business, making everything work together better. This means data and communication flow easily between different parts of the organization, breaking down barriers and making things run more smoothly. With everything connected, teams can work together more easily, saving time and effort and making the whole business more efficient.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Cost Efficiency in the Long Run</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although custom software development might seem more expensive at first compared to off-the-shelf options, it can save a lot of money in the long run. With custom software, businesses don&#8217;t have to pay expensive fees for licenses as they do with other software. Plus, they don&#8217;t have to rely on outside companies for help or maintenance as much, which also saves money over time.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Competitive Advantage through Differentiation</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software helps businesses stand out in the market by offering special features, personalized experiences, and new ideas. This makes customers want to choose them over other companies and keeps them coming back. By using custom software to provide excellent service and value, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and keep growing successfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By investing in custom software, companies can improve their operations, be more flexible, and do better than their competition in today&#8217;s changing business world.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Considerations When Developing Custom Software</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When planning to develop custom software, it&#8217;s important to think about a few key things to make sure it turns out well. Here are some important factors to think about:</span><b></b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40693" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development.png" alt="Key Considerations of Custom Software development" width="860" height="715" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development-300x249.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development-768x639.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development-480x399.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Clear Understanding of Requirements</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting the software development process, it&#8217;s crucial to understand its purpose thoroughly. This involves extensive discussions with stakeholders to determine their needs and expectations. Gathering this information upfront ensures the software will meet all the organization&#8217;s requirements and goals.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Budgeting and Resource Allocation</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making custom software takes a lot of time and money. It&#8217;s important to set a budget that makes sense and use resources well to keep the project on schedule and meet its goals on time. By being careful with how money and time are spent, organizations can avoid spending more than planned and make sure the project goes well.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Choosing the Right Development Partner</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right company to build the software is really important for the project to go well. Find a company that&#8217;s well-known for making good custom software. Consider points like how much they know, how long they&#8217;ve been doing it, and if they fit well with your organization&#8217;s way of doing things. A reliable company can offer helpful insights, advice, and support, ensuring smooth and successful results.</span><b></b></p>

<hr />
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Technology Stack</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking the right tools and technology is another important consideration. Choose the ones that match the project&#8217;s needs, like how big it might get and what it needs to do in the future. Also, think about ease of integration, security, and support, when evaluating technology options. By using the right technology, organizations can make strong, flexible software that works well now and in the future.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Agile Development Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using agile methods while making custom software can keep the project flexible and ready to change if needed. Agile development in software engineering encourages working together, being open, and making things better bit by bit. This means the software can get better quickly and be ready to use sooner. By being agile, organizations can listen to feedback, fix things that aren&#8217;t right, and make sure the software does what people need it to do.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Testing and Quality Assurance</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thorough <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-quality-assurance-testing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software testing and QA services</a></strong> are essential factors of the custom enterprise software development process. Use strong testing methods to find and fix any bugs, errors, or usability issues before launching the software to real potential users. By emphasizing quality assurance throughout the development process, organizations can be sure that the final product meets the ultimate standards of performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.</span></p>

<h2><b>Do You Really Need to Integrate SharePoint with Salesforce?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/salesforce" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">Salesforce development services</a> let you upload and manage documents, they also have limitations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent these limitations from affecting productivity, companies often turn to document collaboration systems like SharePoint to store documents and facilitate collaborations across the Salesforce integration company.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40488 aligncenter" title="Integrate SharePoint with Salesforce" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Integrate-SharePoint-with-Salesforce.jpg" alt="Integrate SharePoint with Salesforce" width="800" height="398" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Integrate-SharePoint-with-Salesforce.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Integrate-SharePoint-with-Salesforce-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Integrate-SharePoint-with-Salesforce-768x382.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Integrate-SharePoint-with-Salesforce-480x239.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is it really important to integrate these two systems? Let&#8217;s see what happens if you stick solely to using Salesforce for your processes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>File size:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In Salesforce, you can upload documents using two options: &#8220;Attachments,&#8221; which supports files up to 25 MB, and &#8220;File,&#8221; which allows files up to 2 GB. However, managing data larger than this can lead to higher storage costs and slow down system performance over time due to the platform&#8217;s multitenant architecture.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Real-time syncing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Changes made on users&#8217; local drives don&#8217;t automatically sync with Salesforce files, and vice versa. Users must upload or download files and then replace them with the new version, as no real-time syncing option is available.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Document accessibility and privacy:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Salesforce documents can only be accessed by non-Salesforce users through a public URL, which raises concerns about GDPR compliance and other data security laws due to the public sharing of documents. One solution is to purchase additional licenses for non-Salesforce users, which can be costly.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>In another scenario, businesses might use Salesforce and SharePoint separately without integrating them. This approach has problems.</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Inefficient process:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Contracts for vendors, customers, and partners often follow the same approval process, which is usually automated within a single workflow management system like SharePoint. However, when it comes to approving contracts, Salesforce users must switch between CRM and SharePoint and vice versa.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Document duplication:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is another issue when Salesforce isn&#8217;t integrated with SharePoint. Typically, the sales team needs to download documents from SharePoint and then upload them to Salesforce whenever they need to share them with their team or clients. This often results in having the same document stored in two systems, causing confusion with file versions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Glitchy team collaboration:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Team collaboration becomes challenging when customer records are stored in Salesforce, but collaboration occurs across both SharePoint and Salesforce. This leads to Salesforce users spending time switching between systems to stay connected with their teams, causing inefficiencies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Content desertion:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Content abandonment occurs when sales teams copy links to SharePoint files in Salesforce but cannot preview or locate them using Salesforce&#8217;s global search. Consequently, valuable content for customer communication ends up buried within SharePoint libraries.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we&#8217;ve explored the drawbacks of not integrating SharePoint and Salesforce, let&#8217;s understand the clear benefits of establishing integration before we proceed to the integration steps.</span></p>

<h2><b>Benefits of Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating SharePoint&#8217;s <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/document-management-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">document management system</a> with Salesforce offers significant advantages to businesses aiming to enhance collaboration between service and sales teams while efficiently managing data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce&#8217;s combined features as a CRM and SharePoint&#8217;s document management and file storage platform work together seamlessly, benefiting businesses greatly.</span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40489 aligncenter" title="Benefits of Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce.jpg" alt="Benefits of Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce" width="800" height="302" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-768x290.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Benefits-of-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-480x181.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><b>1. Enhanced Teamwork</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce improves collaboration not only among sales and service teams but also across departments like marketing and legal. Let&#8217;s explore the benefits of customizing Salesforce with some examples. For instance, picture a situation where a sales executive and a content writer collaborate on crafting a client proposal. With Salesforce integrated with SharePoint, any edits made by the sales executive to the writer&#8217;s document will instantly show up for all team members with access to the document. This ensures everyone stays updated and minimizes the chance of version control issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example is, suppose a legal team examines and approves a contract stored in SharePoint. Once approved, the sales executive can immediately see these changes in Salesforce. This ensures the sales team stays informed when communicating important updates to clients.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>2. Improved System Performance</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major advantage of integrating Salesforce with SharePoint is the enhancement in load balancing. Using each platform separately can strain the systems, resulting in more downtime and slower performance. However, integrating them allows for sharing data and files between the two platforms, leading to better load balancing and eliminating resource wastage from duplications and managing multiple copies.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>3. Analytics and Reporting</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating SharePoint with Salesforce makes analytical and reporting tasks simpler. Data from both platforms can be merged to gain insights into sales performance, document usage, and customer interactions. For instance, using the SharePoint Online Reporting and Auditing tool, teams can analyze frequently accessed documents in the sales process. This provides valuable insights into the resources that have the greatest impact on closing deals or addressing customer issues.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>4. Enhanced Document Security</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating Salesforce with SharePoint provides businesses with access to SharePoint&#8217;s strong security features, such as teams, roles, and permission levels. This helps them comply with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Additionally, the platform allows setting expiration dates for specific files, ensuring that third-party vendors cannot access the file after the expiration date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These four are just the main benefits of Salesforce Sharepoint integration. On a more practical level, there are several other advantages that emerge in day-to-day processes and workflows, including external sharing controls, enhanced data management, increased productivity, and scalability.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The likelihood of experiencing these benefits in your organization hinges on how effectively you execute Salesforce SharePoint integration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before getting into that section, let&#8217;s provide a quick overview of the four guiding principles that can ensure the success of the process.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Principles for Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the current digital economy, successful integrations are vital for creating a productive and efficient organization. Achieving this requires following certain principles or tips for successful Salesforce Sharepoint integration.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40490 aligncenter" title="Key Principles for Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Principles-for-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce.jpg" alt="Key Principles for Integrating SharePoint and Salesforce" width="800" height="264" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Principles-for-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Principles-for-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-300x99.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Principles-for-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-768x253.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Principles-for-Integrating-SharePoint-and-Salesforce-480x158.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data Location:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It&#8217;s important to make sure that data stays within its designated geographic boundaries: where it was made, where it will be used, and where it will be kept. This is especially crucial when complying with regulations concerning privacy and data storage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data Organization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The data you utilize, along with its architecture, should be logically arranged and structured to optimize the integration process. This typically involves labeling, categorizing, and connecting related data points across both Salesforce and SharePoint.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Security:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When integrating SharePoint and Salesforce, prioritize security above all else. While both platforms have strong security measures in place, it&#8217;s important to focus on permissions for file access and tracking their Sharepoint application development usage.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data Distribution:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once data is properly organized and stored, the next step is to plan how it will be accessed and shared. SharePoint offers several features, including setting expiration dates for documents and a dashboard to monitor who has accessed a document.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we&#8217;ve covered the principles of integrating Salesforce and SharePoint let&#8217;s explore the process of connecting the two platforms and any limitations you should be aware of.</span></p>

<h2><b>Common Challenges in Integrating SharePoint with Salesforce and How to Overcome Them</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrating SharePoint with Salesforce can be a challenging process for many businesses that are not familiar with the technical aspects of combining these two large platforms.</span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40493 aligncenter" title="Common Challenges in Integrating SharePoint" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Common-Challenges-in-Integrating-SharePoint.jpg" alt="Common Challenges in Integrating SharePoint" width="800" height="269" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Common-Challenges-in-Integrating-SharePoint.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Common-Challenges-in-Integrating-SharePoint-300x101.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Common-Challenges-in-Integrating-SharePoint-768x258.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Common-Challenges-in-Integrating-SharePoint-480x161.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><b>1. Data Migration</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving data between Salesforce and SharePoint, or vice versa, can be very complex and time-consuming. Businesses need to ensure that their data is correctly formatted, organized, and transferred without any errors like duplication or inaccuracies. To tackle this challenge, they can utilize third-party data migration tools or enlist specialized data migration services to assist with the process.</span><br />
<b></b></p>
<h3><b>2. Customization</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customizing the integration and its outcomes is very challenging when using the Files Connect method. The absence of customization options often leads businesses to either opt for a third-party solution or collaborate with a software development firm to create a custom integration tool.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>3. Data Security</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securing sensitive data and limiting access to authorized users is crucial for a successful Salesforce SharePoint integration. We suggest addressing this by implementing Salesforce Sharepoint integration with security measures such as firewalls, encryption, and access controls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, we&#8217;ve explored various aspects of integrating Salesforce with SharePoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We discussed why relying solely on Salesforce&#8217;s document management feature may not meet the needs of an expanding business and outlined the reasons behind it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, we highlighted the key benefits of integration, discussed the available options for combining the two platforms, and finally, addressed the potential challenges in Salesforce Sharepoint integration you may encounter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a folder named &#8220;Strapi Demo&#8221; and within it, make two directories in the folder: &#8220;Frontend&#8221; and &#8220;Backend&#8221;. These directories will be used to set up a Strapi and <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/api-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">API development &amp; integration services</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the &#8220;Frontend&#8221; folder, you can choose to include React, TezJS, Angular, Nuxt, or Vue for your <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/frontend-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">frontend development</a></strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strapi headless CMS will be installed in the &#8220;Backend&#8221; folder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open your code editor and enter the following commands:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to the backend folder by typing &#8220;cd backend&#8221;. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This command changes the existing directory to the backend folder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you can add the Strapi backend to your project. Use either of the following commands:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For npm, use &#8220;&#8211;quickstart npx create-Strapi-app&#8221;.</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These commands will walk you through the process of installing Strapi in your project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By including &#8216;./&#8217; in the script, Strapi bootstrap will be installed in the current folder. The &#8216;&#8211;quickstart&#8217; flag simplifies the process of setting up Strapi swiftly and efficiently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re transitioning from another backend system like WordPress to Strapi, achieving a seamless match may require some effort. Strapi doesn&#8217;t natively support WP-CRM, so you&#8217;ll need to manually integrate it into your setup, which can take time and effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frameworks like Kirby or Craft come with all the necessary tools for content management and are ready to use. They simply provide an API as an additional feature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, if you&#8217;re already acquainted with REST APIs, working with Strapi shouldn&#8217;t pose much difficulty. However, converting existing endpoints to Strapi can be a daunting task. That&#8217;s why many users opt to use Strapi headless CMS for new projects instead of migrating existing ones.</span><b></b></p>

<hr />
<h4><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #05164d;"><b>2. Strapi Isn&#8217;t Entirely Free and Open Source</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Strapi is an open-source CMS and available for free, it&#8217;s not without its limitations. Strapi also offers a Pro version with extra features like custom plugin support and professional support from their team, including priority email access.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #05164d;"><b>3. Limited TypeScript Support</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strapi doesn&#8217;t natively support TypeScript, which can be disappointing considering its advancements. For advanced users handling large or complex projects, this absence may pose challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you can easily restore TypeScript support using a plugin from the npm repositories. Additionally, since the source code is accessible online, you have the option to create your own plugin for any language.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #05164d;"><b>4. Regular Updates</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strapi headless CMS is constantly evolving, meaning you can anticipate frequent updates. The stable version of Strapi undergoes weekly changes, so it&#8217;s important to stay vigilant if you prefer a consistently stable platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this is common practice for many open-source tools, it can still be inconvenient for <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/dedicated-development-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">dedicated developers</a></strong> who prioritize stable <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software development services</a></strong>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read on to learn how to make Salesforce work for your unique business needs and propel growth to the next level.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding the Need for Customization</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRM customization is vital in improving your business solutions. </span><b>But why is it so important?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, there are several reasons behind it, such as enhanced efficiency, better customer insights, competitive advantage, and many more. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39505 aligncenter" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/understanding.jpg" alt="Need for Customization" width="800" height="550" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/understanding.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/understanding-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/understanding-768x528.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/understanding-480x330.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s learn more about it in detail to help you understand this better: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tailored Solutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Every business is unique, with its challenges and requirements. Off-the-shelf CRM solutions may not always fit perfectly. That&#8217;s where customization services come in. They allow you to tailor your CRM system to align perfectly with your business needs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Increased Efficiency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: By customizing your CRM, you can streamline processes and workflows, making them more efficient. This means less time wasted on manual tasks and more time focused on growing your business.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Better Customer Insights</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A one-size-fits-all CRM may not capture all the data points relevant to your business. With CRM customization, you can track the metrics that matter most to you, gaining valuable insights into your customers&#8217; behavior and preferences.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Competitive Advantage</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Standing out is crucial in today&#8217;s competitive market. Customizing your CRM gives you a competitive edge by allowing you to offer personalized experiences to your customers. Usually, companies Hire Salesforce Developers as their expertise helps them create their unique identity in the market</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility and Scalability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Your CRM needs may change as your business grows and evolves. Off-the-shelf solutions may not be able to keep up. With CRM customization, you can adapt and scale your system as needed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To unlock these benefits, businesses often <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/dedicated-development-teams" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">hire dedicated software development teams</a> specializing in CRM customization. These experts can work closely with you to comprehend your unique requirements and develop tailored solutions that drive business success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By tailoring your CRM system to meet your specific needs, you can improve efficiency, gain valuable insights, and stay ahead of the competition.</span></p>

<h2><b>Common Challenges in CRM Implementation </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing a CRM system, such as Salesforce, for business, can bring many benefits, but it&#8217;s not without challenges. There can be pitfalls related to lack of expertise, data migration, unforeseen complexities, customization requirements, etc. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39507 aligncenter" title="Navigating Challenges in CRM Implementation" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Navigating-Challenges-in-CRM-Implementation.jpg" alt="Navigating Challenges in CRM Implementation" width="800" height="637" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Navigating-Challenges-in-CRM-Implementation.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Navigating-Challenges-in-CRM-Implementation-300x239.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Navigating-Challenges-in-CRM-Implementation-768x612.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Navigating-Challenges-in-CRM-Implementation-480x382.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s track them down and understand the roadblocks businesses can anticipate while implementing CRM: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Complexity of Implementation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Integrating a CRM system into existing workflows can be difficult, especially for businesses with complex processes. Without proper guidance, navigating the intricacies of Salesforce implementation can be overwhelming.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lack of Internal Expertise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: While Salesforce offers robust features and capabilities, harnessing its full potential requires specialized knowledge. Many businesses lack in-house expertise to handle the complexities of Salesforce implementation effectively. To overcome this, businesses often seek mentorship from Digital Transformation Services for expertise and efficiency. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Data Migration Challenges:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Migrating data from legacy systems to Salesforce can be complex and time-consuming. Data accuracy and integrity during migration is crucial to avoid disruptions to business operations.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>User Adoption Issues</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Even the most advanced CRM system is only effective if users embrace it. Poor user adoption can undermine the success of Salesforce implementation. Employees may resist change or struggle to adapt to the new system without proper training and support.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Customization Requirements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Off-the-shelf Salesforce solutions may not always meet the unique needs of every business. Customization is often necessary to tailor Salesforce to specific workflows and requirements. However, without the right expertise, businesses may struggle to customize Salesforce effectively.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses often turn to Salesforce implementation consulting services to overcome these limitations and maximize the advantages of Salesforce implementation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These experts are crucial in guiding businesses through the implementation process, providing strategic guidance, technical expertise, and hands-on support.</span></p>

<h3><b>Assess Your Needs </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before getting into customization, assessing your business requirements and objectives is essential. Take time to identify the pain points, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement within your current processes. Consider factors such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Specific Business Goals</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: What are your primary objectives for implementing Salesforce? Whether it&#8217;s improving sales processes, enhancing customer service, or streamlining marketing efforts, defining clear goals will guide your customization strategy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Workflow Analysis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Analyze your existing workflows to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Where are the pain points? What tasks could be automated or streamlined with Salesforce?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>User Feedback:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gather input from key stakeholders and end-users to understand their needs and preferences. What features or functionalities are essential to their roles? What challenges do they face with the current systems?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above questions will help identify your business requirements for Salesforce customizations. You can also seek assistance from Custom CRM Software Services to do this efficiently and implement the right customization strategies. </span></p>
<h3><b>Understand Salesforce Capabilities</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before beginning the customization, familiarize yourself with Salesforce&#8217;s capabilities and features. Salesforce is a robust platform with many tools and functionalities to support various business processes. Some key components to explore include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Standard Objects</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Salesforce offers standard objects such as Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, and Cases, which serve as building blocks for your CRM system.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Custom Objects: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides standard objects, Salesforce allows you to create custom objects to track unique data specific to your business.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Automation Tools</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Use Salesforce&#8217;s automation tools, such as Workflow Rules, Process Builder, and Flow, to automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Integration Options:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Salesforce integrates seamlessly with various third-party applications and enterprise systems. Explore integration possibilities to enhance functionality and connectivity across your ecosystem.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Plan Your Customization Strategy</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a clear understanding of your needs and Salesforce&#8217;s capabilities, it&#8217;s time to develop a customization strategy. Consider the following steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prioritize Customizations:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Identify the most critical customizations based on your business goals and priorities. Focus on high-impact changes that will deliver the most significant value to your organization.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create a Roadmap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Develop a phased approach to customization, breaking down the process into manageable milestones. Prioritize customizations based on complexity, dependencies, and business impact.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Engage Salesforce Consulting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Consider partnering with <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/salesforce/consulting" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">Expert Salesforce Consulting</a> to guide you through the customization process. Salesforce consultants bring valuable expertise and experience to help you make right decisions and avoid common pitfalls.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Implement and Iterate</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&#8217;ve mapped out your customization strategy, it&#8217;s time to implement it. Implement customizations systematically, following best practices and guidelines provided by Salesforce. Be sure to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Test Thoroughly: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test customizations rigorously to ensure they meet your requirements and function as intended. Solicit feedback from end-users and stakeholders throughout the testing process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Train Users:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Provide comprehensive training to end-users to familiarize them with the customized Salesforce environment. Empower users to take full advantage of the new features and functionalities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Monitor and Iterate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Continuously monitor the performance of your customizations and gather user feedback. Iterate your customization strategy based on insights and evolving business needs.</span></li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Quick Summary</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Software applications today form the digital foundations enabling enterprise growth, resilience, and competitive edge. However, without vigilant, ongoing maintenance extending through operational lifecycles, critical software assets rapidly accumulate technical debt &#8211; degrading system health, security, compliance, and strategic alignment over time.<br />
Ultimately, neglected systems undermine productivity, innovations, and growth. Establishing robust software maintenance policies and procedures can maximize ROI on IT investments while fueling sustained success in increasingly complex, fast-evolving digital business ecosystems.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our increasingly digital economy, software systems, and applications empower organizational growth, efficiency, and competitive advantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, without vigilant software maintenance importance, critical software assets face progressive performance degradation, vulnerability risks, and failure to align with evolving business needs, leading to significant enterprise challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per recent surveys, </span><a href="https://bambooagile.eu/insights/software-maintenance-costs/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b>nearly 90%</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of software lifecycle costs occur during maintenance stages. Also, over 200 billion dollars are spent annually on software maintenance globally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, it is estimated that effective software maintenance strategies can reduce lifecycle costs by as much as 60%. This highlights why continual software maintenance is mission-critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some key reasons include sustaining high software reliability, plugging security loopholes through regular updates, reducing downtimes via preemptive interventions, and adapting systems to market changes for innovation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations prioritizing proactive software asset maintenance are better positioned to realize their strategic and operational objectives while accelerating growth.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Types of Software Maintenance</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four broad <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-maintenance" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">software application maintenance services</a> categories enable organizations to keep their software assets updated and optimized for business continuity and development:</span><b></b></p>

<p><b>1. Corrective Maintenance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involves bug fixing, troubleshooting, and repairs after software failures to restore intended functionality and performance. It aims to address issues that crop up during operational use.</span><b></b></p>
<p><b>2. Adaptive Maintenance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of maintenance enhances software utilities and capabilities to align with evolving business process changes. It helps in customizations for new enterprise requirements.</span></p>

<h2><strong>The Significance of Maintaining Software Vitality</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s extremely competitive and dynamic digital business landscape, organizations cannot afford to let their critical software applications and platforms lag due to a lack of timely software maintenance importance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without proactive maintenance support, software assets face progressive performance and security degradation over time, directly impacting an enterprise’s operational efficiency, responsiveness to market changes, and competitive standing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some key reasons why ongoing software maintenance holds great significance include</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38964 aligncenter" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Group-1000017146.jpg" alt="Importance of Software Maintenance" width="800" height="1065" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Group-1000017146.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Group-1000017146-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Group-1000017146-769x1024.jpg 769w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Group-1000017146-768x1022.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Group-1000017146-348x463.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><b>Enhancing Reliability: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular maintenance enables identifying and fixing defects and failures in software before they disrupt services. It proactively addresses vulnerabilities, improves stability, and sustains optimal performance.</span></p>
<p><b>Plugging Security Risks: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuous updates and patches are vital to mitigate emerging cyber threats like ransomware, hacking, and data thefts. They also strengthen access controls. Neglecting this makes enterprises sitting ducks.</span></p>
<p><b>Facilitating Adaptability: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business and user requirements evolve rapidly. Maintenance incorporates necessary customizations for new functionalities, integrations, technologies, etc. This fail-proofs enterprises against market changes.</span></p>
<p><b>Maximizing ROI: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintenance costs are far more economical than large-scale software replacements when systems degrade severely. It protects software investments.</span></p>
<p><b>Minimizing Downtimes: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventive maintenance preempts failure incidents. Adaptive maintenance ensures alignment with upgraded infrastructures. Both minimize disruptive downtimes.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Quick Overview:</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The on-demand economy is powered by technology-driven platforms that offer instant access to products/services per customer requirement for convenience. Rapid advancements in cloud, digital payments, mobility, and AI enable healthcare, hyperlocal, eCommerce, education, logistics, and other sectors to embrace these customer-centric operating models.  </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">By focusing on flexibility, personalization, and real-time fulfillment, on-demand businesses are disrupting traditional industries by effectively harnessing connectivity and data intelligence to make consumer life easier and more efficient.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The on-demand economy has revolutionized how we access services. With just a few taps on our phones, we can call practically anything to our doorstep &#8211; from groceries and meals to rides and doctors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new era is driven by technology-enabled on-demand service industries catering to our instant gratification. On-demand doctor consultations, food delivery services, online retail, virtual tutoring, fitness apps, ride-hailing services, travel bookings, and real-time package tracking are now deeply embedded into our lifestyles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The convenience and personalization offered by these industries continue to displace old models reliant on in-person interactions and intermediaries. </span></p>
<p><b><i>According to a post, the global on-demand service revenues are expected to reach multi-million or billion USD by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/on-demand-services-market-size-unlocking-growth-potential" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">2023 or 2030</a>. </i></b></p>
<p><b>This raises the question, what is driving this phenomenal growth? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could it be the four-fold decrease in wait times that on-demand services provide? Or the ability to compare costs and quality at the tap of a button? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand and find the answers, let&#8217;s get into the details. This blog post explores eight service industries driving the on-demand economy.  </span></p>

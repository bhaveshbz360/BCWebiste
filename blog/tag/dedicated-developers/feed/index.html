										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Are you looking for dedicated development teams to speed up your business project?</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If yes, then you have landed on the right post, and this will be a worth read for you. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, businesses often find themselves at a crossroads: the need for rapid development vs. the limitations of their in-house resources. This is where dedicated development teams come into play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional project teams with multiple responsibilities, dedicated development teams focus solely on your project. They bring a specialized skill set and strong commitment. Many companies are turning to these teams to </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accelerate timelines</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access niche expertise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain flexibility </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No long-term costs of hiring full-time staff</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s find out how leveraging dedicated development teams can be a game-changer for your tech project&#8217;s success.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Role of Dedicated Development Teams</b></h2>
<p><b>Dedicated development teams are defined as specialized groups of professionals assembled to focus mainly on a specific project or set of projects.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional teams were pulled in multiple directions by various tasks and responsibilities. On the other hand, dedicated development teams offer a concentrated approach and ensure that all their expertise &amp; efforts are aligned with the goals of your project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model allows businesses to </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leverage a tailored mix of skills &amp; experience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide the flexibility to scale up or down </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By integrating seamlessly with your existing processes &amp; culture, dedicated remote development teams act as an extension of your in-house team, but with the added benefit of external expertise and focus.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41382" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Advantages-of-Having-Dedicated-Development-Teams.png" alt="Advantages of Having Dedicated Development Teams" width="860" height="445" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Advantages-of-Having-Dedicated-Development-Teams.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Advantages-of-Having-Dedicated-Development-Teams-300x155.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Advantages-of-Having-Dedicated-Development-Teams-768x397.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Advantages-of-Having-Dedicated-Development-Teams-480x248.png 480w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Advantages-of-Having-Dedicated-Development-Teams-432x225.png 432w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<h3><b>1) Cost-Effectiveness &amp; Budget Control</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When comparing in-house development to dedicated development teams, the contrast in cost savings can be substantial. Dedicated teams </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operate with a streamlined focus on your project</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce the overhead associated with internal staff </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide a clear, fixed cost for project deliverables</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-house teams often require an ongoing investment in training and infrastructure. On the other hand, dedicated teams come up with their own tools &amp; expertise. They help translate to a lower total cost of ownership &amp; operational expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedicated development teams possess a transparent billing model. This allows businesses to track &amp; manage their project budget with precision. This model fosters an environment of accountability &amp; ensures that each penny spent is an investment towards tangible outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, businesses can not only optimize their technology investments but also gain a partner committed to delivering robust &amp; scalable software solutions with the help of dedicated development teams.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3><b>2) Scalability &amp; Flexibility</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedicated development teams adapt swiftly to project changes with a scalable workforce. As project demands fluctuate, having a dedicated team can easily scale up or down without bearing the diffculty of hiring or laying off staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of flexibility ensures that you always have the right number of<strong> <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">skilled developers</a></strong> carrying appropriate skills exactly when you need them.</span></p>
<h4><b>Example: Scaling a Project Up or Down with a Dedicated Team</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose a mid-sized IT consulting firm embarks on a <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">custom software development</a></strong> project. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the project requires a small team of skilled software developers to build the core features. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the project progressed and the company decided to add more advanced functionalities, they needed additional expertise and manpower. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a dedicated development team, they could scale up quickly, bringing in specialists to meet the new requirements without delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a large team is needed less once the project enters the maintenance phase. The company could quickly scale down the dedicated team, retaining only the necessary personnel for ongoing support and updates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This adaptability not only optimizes resource allocation but also controls costs. This demonstrates how <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-software-developers-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">skilled software developers</a></strong> provide the perfect balance of scalability &amp; flexibility to manage any project&#8217;s lifecycle efficiently.</span></p>

<h3><b>3) Access to Top Tech Talent &amp; Expertise</b></h3>

<h3><b>4) Enhanced Collaboration &amp; Communication</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedicated remote development teams excel at building a collaborative environment between the team and the client company. Unlike traditional project teams that may be divided across various tasks, dedicated teams are wholly focused on your project, fostering a deep, ongoing collaboration. This close partnership allows for </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better alignment of goals</span></li>

</ul>
<h4><b>Example of Effective Communication Strategies in a Dedicated Team Set-Up</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective communication defines the success of any dedicated development team. To maintain open lines of communication, regular video conferences, daily stand-up meetings, and real-time messaging platforms viz. </span><b>Slack</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are commonly used. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These strategies ensure that everyone is on the same page. They address issues when they arise and keep the project moving forward smoothly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedicated teams often employ collaborative tools, such as Jira or Trello, to track progress and manage tasks. This makes it easy for both the team and the client to stay updated on the project&#8217;s status. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teams with extended development capabilities create a transparent &amp; efficient workflow by prioritizing clear &amp; consistent communication. This will lead to more successful project outcomes.</span></p>

<h3><b>5) Focus on Innovation &amp; Quality</b></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They employ the following best practices to catch and resolve issues early:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check on Quality assurance</span></li>

<h3><strong>First Stage</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish priorities for your project&#8217;s needs before </span>hiring web app developers<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Analyze your project&#8217;s requirements thoroughly.</span></li>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyze the size of the team and see what types of skills they possess.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team member should be able to design content that engages users.</span></li>

<h3><strong>Common Hiring Models For Dedicated Development Team </strong></h3>
<p>Here are some of the most common hiring models for dedicated development teams to help you make an informed decision for your next project.</p>
<p>1. Dedicated Team Model (DTM): In the DTM, you hire an entire team of software developers, designers, <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/latest-trends-of-qa-engineers-hiring-what-to-look-for-before-hiring-qa-engineers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>QA engineers</strong></a> and other specialists who work exclusively on your project.<br />
The team becomes an extension of your in-house workforce, collaborating with your internal teams seamlessly. Additionally, it offers flexibility, scalability, and complete control over the development process.</p>
<p>2. Time and Material (T&amp;M): This model involves paying for the actual time and resources invested in your project. T&amp;M model provides transparency, and you are billed for the hours worked and the materials used. It suits projects with evolving requirements and scope changes, as you can easily adjust the team size and workload</p>
<p>3. Fixed-Price Model: In a fixed-price model, you and the development company agree on a fixed budget for the entire project. Suitable for well-defined projects with stable requirements, as changes might lead to additional costs.<br />
&#8211; This model provides predictability in costs, making it easier to plan budgets.</p>
<p>4. Retainer Model: In a retainer model, you pay a recurring fee to reserve a certain number of hours per month from the development team. It works well for ongoing maintenance, support, or periodic updates to existing projects.You maintain flexibility while having a dedicated team at your disposal whenever you need them.</p>
<p>5. Project-Based Model: With the project-based model, you hire a dedicated team to work on a specific project with a defined scope and timeline. Once the project is completed, the team is disbanded or moved to other tasks. This model is suitable for short-term projects with clear objectives.</p>
<p>6. Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT): The BOT model involves outsourcing the development initially, and later, transferring the team to your company&#8217;s ownership. It&#8217;s a strategic choice when you plan to establish your development center in the long run.This model provides an opportunity to evaluate the team&#8217;s capabilities before committing to permanent employment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Famous Models To Hire A Dedicated Development Team</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>5. Less Management:</strong> You don’t need to spend time or deal with day-to-day management issues often present in on-site staffing.</p>
<p><strong>6. Qualified Hand-Picked Developers:</strong> It gets you a team of highly trained professionals that has undergone various evaluations and interviews to show that they are qualified.</p>
<p><strong>7. Cost-cutting Techniques:</strong> You can use strategies for cost-cutting, like changing the number of team members at any point in the development process.</p>
<p><strong>8. Complete Control of Development:</strong> The entire developmental process is directly in your hands, so you can modify the existing process or invent something new at any stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>9. No Risk of Data Breach:</strong> Hiring a dedicated development team minimizes the risk of a data breach since most of them guarantee intellectual property protection and data security and sign any related agreements legally.</p>
<h2><strong>Cons of Hiring A Dedicated Development Team</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cons of hiring a dedicated development team are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1 &#8211; It’s Time-Consuming to Find and Screen Candidates<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll need to find the right team, interview candidates, and check references.</span></p>
<p><strong>2 &#8211; Inefficient for Short-term Projects</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team model is inefficient for short-term projects since members need to adapt to the project requirements, which consumes time and reduces efficiency.</span></p>
<p><strong>3 &#8211; Difficult Cost Estimation</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is difficult to do the right cost estimation because of variations in the number of team members and project requirements.</span></p>
<p><strong>4 &#8211; Lack of in-person Communication</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When teams are in the same physical space, it&#8217;s much easier for them to communicate and collaborate. Without this in-person interaction, it can be difficult for team members to build trust and rapport with one another, which can hinder their ability to work effectively together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miscommunication can easily occur when team members cannot physically talk to each other. This can lead to team members&#8217; frustration and cause project timelines delays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after knowing the pros and cons of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/top-benefits-hiring-dedicated-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>hiring a dedicated web development team</strong></a>, it becomes difficult to decide when to hire and when not to hire dedicated software developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s understand when you should or should not hire a team of dedicated developers.</span></p>

<h3><strong>When You Should Hire A Dedicated Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring a team of dedicated developers is idle for complex and lengthy projects that might expand in the future.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Lack of expertise:</strong> When there is a lack of expertise in-house, it might be more efficient to outsource development work to a dedicated team. For example, if your company does not have experience developing mobile apps, hiring a team specializing in mobile app development would be more cost-effective.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Lack of resources</strong>&#8211; It might make sense to hire a dedicated team when there are insufficient resources or the budget for internal development. For instance, if your company does not have the manpower or the financial resources to develop an e-commerce platform in-house, it would be more practical to outsource the project to a team of experts.</span></li>
<li><b>Limited Development Budget &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if your development budget is limited, then hiring a dedicated team may be more affordable than contracting out work individually.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>When Should You Not Hire A Dedicated Development Team?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few conditions when you should not hire a dedicated development team. Some of those conditions are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Lack of development or marketing budget</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; You should not hire a dedicated team if you do not have a development or marketing budget. A dedicated team requires both human and financial resources to be successful, and without these resources, it is unlikely that the team will achieve its goals.</span></li>
<li><b>Lack of tools and support &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You should not hire a dedicated team if you cannot provide them with the tools and support they need to do their job. A good example of this would be if your company does not have an email system or if you do not have an adequate IT infrastructure in place. Without these basic tools, it would be difficult for the team to function properly.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After knowing the conditions of hiring or not hiring a dedicated development team, let’s now check the cost of hiring a dedicated development team.</span></p>

<h2><strong>How To Determine The Cost Of Hiring A Dedicated Development Team</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several factors determine the cost of hiring a dedicated development team. We have mentioned a few here:</span></p>
<h4><b>1. Price of Hiring a Team</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price always makes an important factor in determining whether to hire a dedicated development team. The rates charged by dedicated development teams vary.</span></p>
<h4><b>2. The number of Team Members</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dedicated development team&#8217;s cost is determined by the number of members, which can be adjusted at any time based on your agreement.</span></p>
<h4><b>3. The Hiring Model you Select</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/dedicated-development-teams?utm_source=Organic+-+ValueCoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Hire Dedicated Development Teams</a> on a weekly, hourly, or monthly basis. The cost of hiring depends on the method. Your requirements and financial estimate will determine the most appropriate method for your project.</span></p>
<h4><b>4. Team’s Involvement in Different Stages</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product cost also varies depending on the level of involvement from the team. Product development goes through different levels like product conceptualization, design, development, QA, product deployment and testing, etc. The more the team gets involved in different stages, the more it will charge for the service.</span></p>
<h4><b>5. Salaries &amp; Benefits for Developers</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the range of salaries and benefits for developers in your area. You can also calculate how much it would cost to outsource development work to a company based on the hours you need to complete.</span></p>
<h4><b>6. The Geolocation for Hiring Developers</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can hire developers from different locations worldwide, either from Latin America, Europe, or Asia. However, the geolocation you choose greatly affects the price of hiring the team. Asia offers better prices, and you can get your work done in high quality at half the price. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the whole globe. During this pandemic, most of the enterprises(small to big) adopted remote working for employees and clients&#8217; safety. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the initial days when the lockdown was announced, many companies have faced various sorts of issues while managing to work from home (WFH). Even still few of the organizations are facing the same problems at the stretch of remote team management.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Challenges to Manage a Remote Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A remote team is a group of experts from different time zones, distinct skills, and different cultures working unitedly on a unified project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, all small, moderate, big enterprises are focusing on adopting remote working as this is beneficial for current and upcoming time. </span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the survey, it has been found that <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>82%</strong> of </span>respondents said that they experience less stress.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Harvard Business Review</a></strong>, <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>87%</strong></span> of respondents feel more connected via remote working.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the team works from the office, then it requires less management effort as a comparison to remote working. While managing the remote team, many challenges come across, and some of the <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/5-strategies-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">remote team management </a></strong>challenges are related to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the Top Communication Tool</li>
<li>Hiring the Correct Resources</li>
<li>Lacking Accountability Program</li>
<li>Noticing Everyone&#8217;s Time</li>
<li>Unclear Roles and Tasks</li>
<li>Lack of Schedule</li>
<li>Unmanageable Employee Tracking</li>
<li>Lack of Conversation within the Team</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Is The Biggest Advantage of Remote Working?</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1111309/biggest-benefits-to-working-remotely-worldwide/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Statista </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated that in 2020, 32% of respondents said that flexibility is one of the most significant benefits of remote working. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility not only helps employees, but it also benefits the organizations now you might be thinking how?</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well, when the employees are given work flexibility, then they try to complete and deliver the task on time, and this finally increases business productivity.</span></p>

<h2><strong>7 Significant and Efficient Ways To Manage Remote Team</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If at some point, working virtually is useful then similarly, it also has few drawbacks like it requires perfect remote team management.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the employee of the company will be productive, then only you will be able to boost the business growth, but for that, it is indispensable to manage the <strong><a href="https://www.workstatus.io/blog/workforce-management/remote-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">remote working</a></strong> properly. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should do a proper module to manage the remote team and work. I have mentioned a few ways that will help you to manage the remote team. </span></p>
<ol style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><strong>Make Use Of Modern Technologies</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Proper Checkment On Punch In and Punch-Out</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Don&#8217;t Let Communication Gap Hamper your Productivity</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Make Sure that Your Team Is Satisfied</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus On Final Result Not on Activity</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Arrange Proper Resources</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Offer Flexibility</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Proper Record On Punch In and Punch-Out</strong><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13767 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2.jpg" alt="Punch in &amp; Punch out" width="500" height="300" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2.jpg 500w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team2-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever you are managing the remote team, then suggest them to make proper punch in and punch out. If you are a team leader, then you should daily check the employees punch in and punch out. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing that does not end here means if in case the employee forgets to make a punch in and punch out then as a leader you should once ask the employee why he/she doesn&#8217;t mark the check-in or check out.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the new member has joined the team, then the management team should accurately provide them guidance related to check-in and check out. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage this process in a proper manner you can also forward a gentle reminder associated with the same task, and for doing this, you can build a group on Skype, Zoom, Google&#8217;s Team Hangouts.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Make Use Of Modern Technologies for remote team management</strong></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage the <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/dedicated-development-teams?utm_source=remote_team_al&amp;utm_medium=remote_team_wblog&amp;utm_campaign=SME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">remote team</a> </strong>in a good manner, you should keep your team connected, and for this, you can use various communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to make everyone engaged.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On using modern technologies, your team will also be able to explore and learn new technological features. There are numerous tasks like tracking, communicating that can be done quickly while making use of advanced technologies.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Coronavirus pandemic, several companies preferred the custom software for managing and tracking their employee&#8217;s work. This mainly helped team leaders and management as it saved the working time and also allowed them to focus on other important work. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If in case you are also looking forward to developing the custom software for your making remote team management easier, then connect with the leading <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">software outsourcing company</a></strong>. </span></p>

<h3><strong>Don’t Bring Communication Gap &#8211; Stay Connected</strong></h3>
<p><b></b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13768 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3.png" alt="dedicated teams" width="512" height="318" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/team3-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arranging formal or informal meetings with the team will help you all to get connected. While working remotely, there are so many issues that are faced by the employees, try to fix those issues &amp; queries on video or voice call.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, voice and video call facilities are available mostly on all apps like Skype, Zoom so for arranging the meeting you can use such apps. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling is the best way to interact with the team, and this also helps the team to connect with the leaders directly. So pic your phone or video call rather than emailing.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to communicate on the video call; this will help you in recognizing employee expression, and to know whether the employee and clients are interested in the talk or not.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Make Sure that Your Team Is Satisfied</strong></h3>
<p>Being out of sight, you may address problems in knowing the needs of every employee. But try to understand the same by recognizing the clues given by the employees.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get an effective outcome from the team, leaders should try to fulfill the requirements of the team. If the employee is satisfied, then he/she will only be able to provide an effective result. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase the workflow as a team leader, you should know from which situation the employee is going through.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an employee is encountering any sort of issues that can be resolved from your side, then try to fix the same. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In remote working, employees face various problems like internet issues, lack of communication, etc this can be resolved by providing great IT support, and as a result, you get exceptional remote team management.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Focus On Final Result Not on Activity</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the team is working remotely then focus on the employee&#8217;s work, which means you need to check whether the employee&#8217;s work is productive or not! whether he/she is submitting tasks on time or not! Try not to focus on the activity of the remote employees; it is not possible to trace or track all work activity.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think if employees are completing their tasks on time and offering you valuable work, then its activity hardly matters for the organization. You can also encourage the team members; this will boost team performance.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Arrange Proper Resources</strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All employees that work in the organization don&#8217;t have proper working setup (laptop, internet connectivity) back at home. So, as a team leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to arrange the assets for the employees. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the COVID-19 pandemic, many employees faced and even facing issues related to working stations, laptops, active internet, etc. If in case your team members are also confronting the same problem then you should adequately guide him/her to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also connect your team members with the IT team to resolve the technical glitches; this will save your time and will also fix the employee concerning issues faster. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a new member has joined the team then as a team leader, it&#8217;s your responsibility to make sure that whether the software and other necessary tools have been correctly installed on the employee work station or not.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Offer Flexibility</strong></h3>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your team is working remotely, then the company should offer flexibility to the employees, this magnifies the employees work performance and also helps them to deliver the task on time. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are offering flexibility to the employees then as a team leader, you should observe employees&#8217; total working hours.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major drawback of work from home (WFH) is that along with working remotely, you need to manage other tasks also and that this somewhere affects the employee work who are not given the flexibility.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a software product is an exciting journey that involves proper planning, construction, implementation, and patience when it is finally released to the market. Considering the competition in today&#8217;s rapidly changing and fast-paced business world, it is essential to launch your product as soon as possible, and you can achieve this by starting with the development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog aims to provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to create a complete software product from MVP app development. We will cover everything from identifying your target audience to scaling and growth.</span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<h2><b>What Is MVP?</b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_29807" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-29807" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-29807" title="What is an MVP" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-is-an-MVP_.jpg" alt="What is an MVP" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-is-an-MVP_.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-is-an-MVP_-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-is-an-MVP_-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-29807" class="wp-caption-text">What is an MVP</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP stands for &#8220;Minimum Viable Product. It is a product designed to help you learn about and test your business idea before you build a final product. The product has enough features to meet the needs of early adopters and get the valuable feedback that can be used to upgrade the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several things to keep in mind when building an MVP startup:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your product is simple enough to test quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep track of how many users use your product and make changes based on their feedback. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on what your users need most right now either </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/product-ui-ux-design?utm_source=ValueCoders+-+mvp-to-full-fledged-product&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">product UI/UX design services</a> or product consulting services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t over complicate or add more features until you have validated what they actually needed.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Importance Of MVP In Product Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP software development is a proven approach for testing your product idea and validating your market before committing to a full-fledged product. It is a stripped-down version of a product that includes essential features &amp; functionalities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP app development is becoming increasingly popular among businesses nowadays for the many benefits that can make or break the success of your product.</span></p>

<h3><b>Validate Product Idea</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP software development is an ideal way to cost-effectively evaluate the success potential of a product concept. With its minimal version, one can obtain customers&#8217; insight and remarks that can be used to better the product and ensure it fulfills the desired users&#8217; requirements.</span></p>
<h3><b>Faster time-to-market</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP accelerates the product development process and gets the product out in the market faster. By solely focusing on the essential features, teams can launch a product in no time. Hence, it is a great advantage in today&#8217;s cut-throat markets, where the first-mover gets the most.</span></p>
<h3><b>Saves time &amp; money</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a complete product may require a considerable investment of resources. By using the MVP strategy, businesses can analyze the viability of an idea without dedicating too much time and funds to it. In this way, they can concentrate on essential components rather than adding excessive components.</span></p>
<h3><b>Builds a Community</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP app development can assist in the creation of an early adopter community that is enthusiastic about the product. This group can supply beneficial advice, help promote the item, and potentially create a new consumer base.</span></p>
<h3><b>Better User Experience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teams need to garner feedback from early adopters in product development to fine-tune the user experience and ensure that the product is attractive to the target audience. Making required changes during this time ensures a successful outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, MVP in product development is an impressive way to validate your ideas, save time &amp; money, improve user experience, and build a community of new product adopters. Furthermore, it helps you know your potential users and how the product is positioned for success in the long run.</span></p>

<h3><b>Understanding Your Target Audience</b></h3>
<p>The first step in building a full-fledged product from an MVP is to fully understand your target audience. Some best ways to follow while having a good understanding of your customers are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying people who will be using your product by conducting online surveys or via interviews</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathering data on their needs and preferences</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting market research to validate your product ideas</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To become successful in this process, it is essential to be comprehensive. You need to ensure sufficient time to familiarize yourself with your consumers, the obstacles they face, and the aspects they need in a product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These insights will be an indispensable asset as you create your MVP and refine your product scheme.</span></p>

<h3><b>Developing The MVP</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you understand your target audience, it is the right time to build your MVP. This involves defining the MVP&#8217;s core features, choosing the right MVP app development method, and building and testing the MVP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should focus on the core features that will help you achieve your goals. Also, avoid adding too many features too soon, which can slow down the development process and result in a cluttered product.</span></p>
<p><b>Here, we have listed steps that will help you get started with MVP software development:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Choose a pain point that your customers are experiencing.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Figure out who your target market is.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Research what other <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/startup-consulting-services?utm_source=ValueCoders+-+mvp-to-full-fledged-product&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">product consulting services</a> solve the same problem or pain point as yours.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Create a rough prototype of your product and test it with potential customers.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Refine and perfect your product based on customer feedback.</span></li>

<h3><b>Building the Full-Fledged Product</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a full-fledged product from an MVP seems an impossible task. After all, your final product should make your customers happy. For this, you need to follow the step-by-step instructions listed below:</span></p>
<p><b>Define Your Product Vision &amp; Goals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have a clear idea of your product&#8217;s purpose and its advantages for the users. An explicit understanding of the product will enable the creation of features tailored to customer demands.</span></p>
<p><b>Analyze Your Competition</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure you provide customers with the features they need, it&#8217;s essential to explore the competition and appraise their features. Researching this before beginning product development enables you to tailor features based on customer insights rather than just guesses.</span></p>
<p><b>Create A User Persona </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will provide insights into the needs of the intended users and allow you to prioritize the features according to these requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>Develop Wireframes &amp; Prototypes</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an in-depth understanding of your product&#8217;s capabilities, the next step is to create wireframes and prototypes to test its feasibility and confirm usability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to listen to customer feedback and make changes based on their needs. This will help you build a product that meets the needs of your target audience and is well-received in the market.</span></p>
<h3><b>Launching the MVP</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you have a full-fledged product developed, and it&#8217;s time to launch. This involves</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing the MVP to potential customers </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathering feedback  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving the MVP app development</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing is a key component of this step. Hence, ensure you have a well-thought-out marketing strategy in place and take advantage of all the marketing channels available.</span></p>
<h3><b>Scaling and Growth</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you scale and grow your product, you need to keep an eye on your product’s key metrics and continuously improve it based on customer feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This step involves the following things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing a scalable infrastructure</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a strong brand and marketing strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding the product to new markets</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is all about the rules and practices that assist in connecting tech, non-tech teams, and project stakeholders in bringing ideas into digital products or software solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process starts from ideation and concludes with product features, pricing strategy, and distribution strategy. In the beginning, the processes hover around the area and market. Although the product development process aims to maximize the product value and mitigate the risk, failure occurred due to poor quality, noncompetitive pricing, retard and premature entry, weak promotion, and bad brand awareness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, now you would have understood what the software product development process is. Let&#8217;s take an in-depth glance into the processes it consists of.</span></p>

<h2><b>Step By Step Software Product Development Processes </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software development process is an amalgamation of different processes, and each has its own significance that empowers the complete process with different attributes and insights. Owing to that, many businesses consider </span>product development consulting<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do everything right in step by step order. So, let&#8217;s take a glance at the step-by-step processes included in software <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/startup-product-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">product development for startups</a>.</span></p>
<h3><b>#1. Brainstorming The Ideas &amp; Planning </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brainstorming is the initial stage of this cycle, where we define the concept for the product. First, it begins with a great idea that you need to carefully think over in order to implement. Besides, the processes can also be termed as idea generation, as we think of every step or stage of the product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact is that a business generates a number of ideas, and a handful is good. The process may include : </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussing the project value and idea with the development team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather information from the market or go through the market statistical occurrence </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describing the concept and idea on a document and sought <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/request-approval-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">approval of stakeholders</a> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you brainstorm over all the ideas and decide the one to implement, It&#8217;s time for planning. Meticulous planning is one core phase of software development. It determines the scope of the project and defines means that can meet strategic business objectives. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20650" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC.png" alt="" width="902" height="528" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC.png 902w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC-300x176.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://www.scnsoft.com/blog/software-project-planning" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, planning also includes considering resource availability &amp; allocation, cost determination and budgeting, timeframe, and determining solutions. Once the perfect plan is determined, you are ready to move forward. Although having a detailed plan is another perk that can turn out very fruitful. </span></p>
<h3><b>#2. Product Research &amp; Requirement Analysis </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is critical to have the right product concept in your mind. If you miss out on this, you can fail to validate your idea first and then end up losing precious time in re-considering. Product research and validation enable you to ensure that you are going to develop a product that users will like to pay for, and you won&#8217;t be wasting time or money. Here are the ways you can conduct product research to validate your idea. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduct an online survey to get feedback </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin a crowdfunding campaign </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking for feedback on forums like Quora or Reddit </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researching in the demand </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this phase, you would be able to define the project in detail and analyze the feasibility. During this process, you need to gather a deeper understanding of the project goal and collect all requirements.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20651" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfgdf.png" alt="" width="566" height="294" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfgdf.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfgdf-300x156.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">product development engineer</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carry out the feasibility analysis that allows them to consider all technical and economic aspects and impacts on the development process, time, resources, tasks, team members, and calculating ROI is majorly defined in the feasibility analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although requirement analysis assists in identifying risks in the beginning stage, it helps identify the risk mitigation strategies that can be implemented from the beginning. </span></p>
<h3><b>#3. Prototyping &amp; Design </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prototyping is the process of creating the preliminary product to test the design of the product and validate the idea. It enables product developers to cater a solution to stakeholders, which can be used for marketing purposes. Once you develop a prototype, your product starts taking a form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After prototyping comes the design of the product, where the actual conceptualization of the solution happens. In design, the detailed software architecture gets developed to meet specific project requirements. The custom-tailored software design helps in defining workflow and standards. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20652" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vxcvzc.png" alt="(Design Principles In Software Development" width="766" height="517" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vxcvzc.png 766w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vxcvzc-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Design Principles In Software Development)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/principles-of-software-design/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, it encompasses overall solution design along with the database. In this phase, the complete product is developed as a mockup or prototype for the next stage of </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=website-20648-productdev-process&amp;utm_medium=d7&amp;utm_campaign=website-20648-productdev-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>custom software development</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From features of the solution to defining hardware and software components are inclusive. </span></p>
<h3><b>#4. Development &amp; Coding </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the designing has been done, now comes development, which majorly includes code writing and transforming design documents into an actual software project. It is the lengthiest cycle of a software development project, as being the backbone of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole process relies on this and a vital thing to pay attention to. The work of the software engineering team is that its code meets the software requirement specification and matches the stakeholder&#8217;s requirement. However, the previous stage of software is fulfilled carefully then a ready-to-use software is bound to match the needs. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-21279" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfddfdf-1.png" alt="" width="566" height="294" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this phase, the software release cycle takes place in three stages, including alpha, beta, release to actual product. </span></p>
<h3><b>#5. Integration &amp; Testing </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when the software is developed, then comes the next phase involving system testing and integration. The process can vary due to the testing processes. But Typically, QA engineers leverage a wide range of frameworks along with integration executing unit tests, automation compilation, and manual testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QA team performs a number of tests, including functional testing, interoperability, system integration, and acceptance testing, etc., in order to ensure that code is clean and the business goals of the solution are met. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, validation and verification are critical aspects of </span>software product development services<b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">ensuring the application/solution is completed successfully. When the software turns into a bug-free solution, deployment starts.</span></p>

<h3><b>#6. Implementation and Deployment </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the process where actual thing-installation happens of the solution. It is a retrospective process after the implementation plan. In this phase, the newly developed and tested application goes forwards to the production stage with the inclusion of data and component transfer. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20654" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfdff.png" alt=" Implementation and Deployment" width="626" height="225" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfdff.png 551w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfdff-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the specific changes will be deployed during the release. Moreover, it can be a straightforward release depending on the complexity of the project. After this, system analysts and end-users can actually try the ready-made application. </span></p>
<h3><b>#7. Operations &amp; Maintenance </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now comes the final stage, where the software development life cycle includes maintenance and regular updates. The phase is regarded as of utmost importance as you collect the real-world feedback and tweak the solution in order to polish it, enhance, and upgrade the fine-tuned solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this phase, the performance gets looked at, and an upgrade takes place to modify the solution according to need and performance aspects. The actual need of the end-user and new capabilities are met by additional user requirements. </span></p>
<h2><b>Wrapping Up </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, the software development processes vary from company to company depending on the aim, such as delivering the best quality product that satisfies the need of product demand. Moreover, customer demand is the major aspect targeted during the processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The processes of </span>product development engineering<span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be shaped and altered depending on the need of each particular project, such as app development, a software provider to identify precise action, and the particular goals achieved. At the same time, the process declaration is a foundation measure to arrange the model for defining frameworks and equip team members in both technical and non-technical works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the quality of code and solution in general, the expectation needs to meet the project manager&#8217;s decision-making progress and more. In the end, the final product is all that matters. Relevant software development processes can help in meeting the customer&#8217;s expectations and by well-tailored and great software solutions that meet business needs and offer exceptional customer satisfaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, SDLC helps programmers to stay on top and keep complete information of the project, while the management team can focus on determining the ways to the timely and efficient delivery of software. Moreover, if you have a </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/dedicated-development-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">dedicated development team</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then you can be a step ahead in software engineering and achieve great results. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has ideas. But do we realize how difficult thriving, workable products or services? Indeed, a hard nut to crack. You need to be innovative while still delivering worth a penny.</p>
<p>According to McKinsey Global Institute data, only 1 out of 7 ideas result in a successful product, and the failure rates for newly launched products are between 25%-45%. Using a structured approach, you’ll stand a greater chance of avoiding any pitfalls resulting in your new product’s failure.</p>
<p>As said by late Apple founder Steve Jobs: “People are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”</p>
<p>But that does not guarantee that the new product will sell like hotcakes. You need to invest time with good command of customer &amp; market needs, your competitors, and offering products with clear value to beat the odds.</p>
<p><strong>This is where the 7 Stages Of Product Development Help:</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20074 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839.png" alt=" Stages Of Product Development " width="2048" height="368" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839.png 2048w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-300x54.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-1024x184.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-768x138.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-1536x276.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involving customers at the early stage helps NPD process and understand their problem before executing ideas into process, tools, and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Necessity leads to invention. That’s where the New Product development Process(NDP) will help. A very simplified process to convert ideas into a tested concept into viable products and eliminate non-feasible ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where the </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/stages-of-new-product-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">new product development process (</a></strong>NDP<strong>)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes into play. This process is designed to aid the conversion of new and untested concepts into viable products and market them while allowing you to weed out non-feasible ideas.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Is New Product Development?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New product development is all about converting an idea into a business-strategic workable software development product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Product Development (NPD) process involves researching existing products in the market with a customer-centric approach, feasibility of the idea, delivering working software and latching on the market opportunities, and delivering working software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product development is an umbrella term that covers six stages of SDLC and working and has a POC. The</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Product Development</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">approach revolves around an entirely new idea, where the uncertainty around its development and the next option remains high. Software</span> product development companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">are progressively exploring NPD facets to address development glitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is about releasing the latest software product, you should seek services from leading </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software product development services</a><b>;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then, always a fair <strong>idea</strong> to join hands with leading firms.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 1: Idea Generation</b></h2>
<p><strong>Emphasize On Customer Problems: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good entrepreneur can scan the issues faced by the target audiences.  You can always identify the issues the customer is facing.</span></p>
<h3><strong>a) Personal Roadblocks</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or a buyer, the customer&#8217;s tendency always remains the same. All you need to do is prioritize one problem, derive a solution, and tag it” one for all. If you’re looking to set the tone right before product development, subscribing to </span>product design and development companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">could help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to apply your brain behind digital offerings. The communication gap often leads to many problems&#8212;&#8211; and is the biggest hurdle towards the path to productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a product and launching it can have some ups and downs, but there should focus on making up a great business idea.</span></p>
<h3><b>b) </b><b>Qualify Each Of The Listed Problems</b></h3>
<p><b>Here is the 4 U strategy:</b></p>
<p>Let’s discuss each of these aspects in detail.</p>
<p><b>Unworkable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out whether the brainstormed product concepts will address some real problems. Will the product be able to fill the existing customer experience gaps and will achieve product-market fit?</span></p>
<p><b>Unavoidable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the problem that you are working on inevitable to the extent that it becomes mandatory to comply? You need to find out whether solving that problem is a choice or a compulsion.</span></p>
<p><b>Urgent:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is the problem urgent and is highly demandable by the target market? If the answer is affirmative, this could be your chance to cover the white space in the market with your original product.</span></p>
<p><b>Underserved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there no available products that address the existing user problems? Look for the whitespace in the market and hold on to the idea that looks promising.</span></p>
<h3><b>c) </b><b>Emerging With Possible Solutions </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the problem gets figured out, you can start looking for possible solutions with a </span>product development firm <span style="font-weight: 400;">to produce feasible solutions. For every new user problem, there’ll be a new NPD service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have figured out the problem, it’s time to look for possible solutions. For every user problem, there ought to be potential new product development opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the workflow that starts from a problem and ends up with strategizing around the solution.</span></p>
<h3><b>d) Narrowing Down The Problems</b></h3>
<p>Categorize all shortlisted problems using a comparison chart with solutions<b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Circulate the findings across the organizational structure to come up with a viable problem set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case stakeholders are reserved, you can Replicate, Re-purpose, and with an upgrade approach.</span></p>
<p><b>Replicate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  You can create a similar product with. a competitor and launch it in the new market conditions. Once MVP(Minimum Viable Product) is launched, then you should prioritize out-of-the-box features.</span></p>
<p><b>Re-Purpose</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  You can rewire the existing business model and present it in the most viable manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It focuses on rewiring an existing business model—for instance, LinkedIn Learning &amp; e-learning platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Upgrading: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This concept of NPD revolves around the existing model with some improvements. Be it performance, speed, or addressing challenges of competitors with added functionalities. </span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 2: Idea Screening</b><b>      </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new product development stage is about choosing the idea that gives you the highest potential for success. You can put all your ideas collectively for internal review, i.e., seek the advice of people with industry knowledge and experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When developing a new product idea, leverage the advantage of POC (Proof of Concept) to check the feasibility of the concept. One can’t zero on an idea that is not technically feasible to build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can consult the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/on-demand-teams/why-startups-choose-dedicated-teams-for-agile-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Agile development teams</a>&#8212;&#8211;expertise helps understand the technical side of things and helps shortlist ideas worth building a PoC. In India, </span>software product development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> leading-age technology solutions give the prospects a smooth development experience</span></p>
<p><b>SWOT (</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities &amp; Threats</span><b>) </b>is prevalent and good practice while shortlisting New Product development ideas.</p>
<p>The agile development team, product owner, scrum master, and product manager go through a detailed analysis and shortlist ideas&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; opportunities and strengths, threats picture and weaknesses.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a SWOT is relatively simple, and you need a simple 2×2 grid to get started:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWOT Analysis Template | New Product Development</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, your New Product Development idea should be unique so that you do not have to convince people to pay for it.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 4: Value Proposition Strategy </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great asset of </span>product development companies in India <span style="font-weight: 400;">before they launch any product. You should be very particular about the capabilities of new products. Once you are good to go with the idea’s utility, you can pitch it clearly to the end-user. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It ensures that a product or service positions around customer exact values and needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the form of a </span>value proposition<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can showcase what your product is capable of doing.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20135" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.png" alt=" value proposition" width="566" height="276" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.png 850w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4-300x146.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4-768x374.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<h2><b>Stage 5:Concept Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are ready with the proposition in </span>software product development<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can now present it to the set of selected customers. The key is to have trust and belief in your ideas. Since the concept doesn’t look promising, you’ll repeat steps to develop a new project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get meaningful insight by focusing on four critical aspects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identification of the focus group, i.e., people who would benefit from the new product under development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessment of other alternatives to be offered to the focus group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Devising a foolproof plan for the New Product Development right from features, marketing, pricing, and distribution</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integration of unique product features into the customer’s mind for findability and discoverability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20136" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5.png" alt="" width="543" height="831" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5.png 1132w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-196x300.png 196w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-668x1024.png 668w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-768x1176.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-1003x1536.png 1003w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /></p>

<h2><b>Stage 6: Product Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span>product development software companies<span style="font-weight: 400;"> start, execution of ideas occurs, the business strategy is documented &#8212;- you can go ahead with the product development cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Product Development starts with developing the prototype followed by MVP.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Prototype</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creation of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/product-ui-ux-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">UI/UX of the product</a> and share with the stakeholders helps visualize the product’s feasibility in the marketplace.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</b></h3>
<p>Using Agile for the new products gives a different look.  Once the product goes through the design &amp; steps &#8212; the product gets launched with minimal features.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile Product development is better than conventional. The waterfall model complements the to-and-fro movement across the development cycle and ideal for last-time changes.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20137" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.png" alt="" width="435" height="326" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Maintaining Communication &amp; Synchronization are the key highlights of Agile Model</b></p>
<h2><b>Stage 7: Market Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps in New Product Development aims to reduce the uncertainty revolving around the </span>software product development<span style="font-weight: 400;">, i.e., checking the viability of the new product or its marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>There are two market testing strategies to follow:</b></p>
<h3><b>1. Alpha Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of testing allows testing engineers to judge any product based on performance and map the marketing mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of any issues, the changes are planned and implemented before the final go-ahead.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Beta Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selected group of customers gives unbiased feedback to the organization. It is all about listening to customers’ voices when issuing a move back to the development team for fixtures.</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s how Alpha and Beta testing are different from each other:</b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20139" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf.png" alt="" width="513" height="471" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf.png 750w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /></p>
<p>The third form of testing conveyed product validation and is called In-Home Usage Test (IIHUT). Development products are meant for intended customers who will use the products.</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s begin by understanding what exactly Agile software development is and how adopting Agile principles can significantly reduce time to market, give businesses a competitive edge, and reduce time to market to drive success.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Agile Software Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile methodology is defined as the popular approach in the field of software development that mainly focuses on collaboration, flexibility, and customer-centricity. It focuses on iterative progress through small, manageable increments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/on-demand-teams/why-startups-choose-dedicated-teams-for-agile-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">dedicated Agile teams</a></strong> to adapt to changing requirements &amp; deliver value to customers more quickly &amp; efficiently.</span></p>
<h3><b>Key Principles &amp; Values of Agile</b><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-41126" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile.png" alt="Key Principles &amp; Values of Agile" width="748" height="397" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-300x159.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-768x407.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the list of key principles involved in Agile software development:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Iterative Development:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Agile methodology promotes breaking down the software development process into smaller i.e. iterative sprints or iterations. Each iteration involves designing, planning, developing, and testing a small functionality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Collaboration: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Agile&#8217;s core values is fostering close collaboration among cross-functional teams. Developers, testers, designers, and stakeholders work together during the entire project. They also ensure everyone is aligned &amp; contribute expertise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile teams often adjust their plans quickly and priorities as project requirements evolve based on customer feedback or market changes. This type of flexibility helps respond to new insights without disrupting the overall project flow.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Focus on Customers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Agile emphasizes delivering value to the customer. Agile teams also ensure that the final software product meets users&#8217; needs &amp;expectations. This iterative feedback loop helps refine features and functionalities based on real-world usage and feedback.</span></li>

<h3><b>Comparison with Traditional Software Development Methods</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By comparing Agile approach with other traditional methods, it will become clear how Agile&#8217;s adaptive &amp; responsive nature can accelerate time to market. This will ensure that the software effectively meets user needs &amp; market demands.</span></p>
<p><b>1. <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/agile-vs-waterfall-which-software-methodology-is-best-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Agile vs Waterfall</a>:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional software development methods i.e. the Waterfall model, follow a linear &amp; sequential approach. Each phase (in terms of requirements, design, development, testing, and rapid deployment) must be completed before moving towards the next. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This further leads to long development cycles and challenges accommodating changes once a phase is completed.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Predictability vs. Flexibility:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">While traditional methods offer predictability &amp; structured planning, they often lack the flexibility to adapt to these changes. Conversely, Agile embraces change &amp; uncertainty. This allows teams to pivot and make adjustments as needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes Agile particularly well-suited for projects with evolving requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Feedback Cycles:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In traditional methods, feedback typically comes late in the process, often during the testing phase or after deployment. Agile incorporates regular feedback throughout the development cycle, enabling continuous improvement and early identification of issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reduces the risk of major problems emerging late in the project.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Importance of Time to Market for Businesses</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve already stated earlier, scaling legacy apps can be challenging as the business grows. Even a single change in any one part may impact the complete systems and require a complete application redeployment.</span><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>2. Dependency Management</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A legacy system upgrade is also necessary because these apps have some dependencies between components. In most cases, managing and upgrading these dependencies can be troubling.</span><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>3. Lack of Agility</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legacy application migration and modernization are often slow to transform. This can impact businesses and make it complicated to meet changing market trends and dynamic user requirements quickly.</span><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>4. Expensive Updates</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve already pointed out, every component is interconnected, therefore, even a single change may lead to redeployment. This can be a expensive process for businesses. </span><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>5. One-point failure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge that engineers face with monolithic legacy systems is one-point failure. This means a single glitch in one component may bring down everything available in the application, since all the components are interlinked to each other, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reading all these challenges, are you feeling annoyed by these limitations with monolithic applications?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let these limitations impact your progress.

<h2><strong>Understanding Application Modernization and the Cloud</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we get into the details, let’s first understand what application modernization strategy is.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40083 aligncenter" title="Understanding Application Modernization and the Cloud" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Understanding-Application-Modernization-and-the-Cloud.jpg" alt="Understanding Application Modernization and the Cloud" width="800" height="489" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Understanding-Application-Modernization-and-the-Cloud.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Understanding-Application-Modernization-and-the-Cloud-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Understanding-Application-Modernization-and-the-Cloud-768x469.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Understanding-Application-Modernization-and-the-Cloud-480x293.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/glossary/application-modernization" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b>Cognizant</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Application modernization is the process of updating legacy applications to scalable, cloud-native app environments by using modern technology stacks. Through this process, applications can continue to meet modern user expectations as they evolve. “</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we break this definition, this basically includes two parts, the first is </span><b>migration </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the second is </span><b>cloud</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, modernizing monolithic applications is majorly dependent on these two crucial components.</span></p>
<p><b>Migration is the process of moving an app from its existing environment to a new one, for instance cloud</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Whereas, the cloud is a group of remote resources or servers that can be accessed using the Internet. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This offers a scalable and flexible infrastructure for accessing and hosting applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud is commonly used for modernizing monolithic applications due to digital transformation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unlocking-business-acceleration-in-a-hybrid-cloud-world" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b>McKinsey</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has an interesting take, it says monolithic apps must be migrated or modernized to the cloud in order to stay relevant in today’s digital ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the basic purpose of modernizing monolithic application is restructuring the legacy system coder to make it easily understandable. This can be further quickly updated to meet future business requirements.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Streamlining Applications from Monolithic Architecture to the Cloud</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40084 aligncenter" title="Streamlining Applications from Monolithic Architecture to the Cloud" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Streamlining-Applications-from-Monolithic-Architecture-to-the-Cloud.jpg" alt="Streamlining Applications from Monolithic Architecture to the Cloud" width="800" height="346" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Streamlining-Applications-from-Monolithic-Architecture-to-the-Cloud.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Streamlining-Applications-from-Monolithic-Architecture-to-the-Cloud-300x130.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Streamlining-Applications-from-Monolithic-Architecture-to-the-Cloud-768x332.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Streamlining-Applications-from-Monolithic-Architecture-to-the-Cloud-480x208.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be wondering how to move old applications to the cloud and smoothly connect them to the digital world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned before, the major challenge of monolithic apps is their rigidity and inflexible nature. Such type of architecture makes the application opaque to the outside world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such cases, despite being able to see the inputs and outputs, there is no transparency about the application’s internal process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of legacy applications should be kept separately by migrating them to an open-source cloud environment. This will allow interoperability with other cloud services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, legacy monolithic codes usually need to be refactored into microservices.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What are Microservices?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><b>Amazon AWS</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explains: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.”</span></i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40085 aligncenter" title="What are Microservices" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-are-Microservices.jpg" alt="What are Microservices" width="800" height="525" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-are-Microservices.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-are-Microservices-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-are-Microservices-768x504.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/What-are-Microservices-480x315.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main highlight of this definition consists of two key terms, “small” and self-contained teams”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a state-of-the-art approach that includes splitting monolithic applications into smaller components. These components communicate with each other and perform particular functions using well-defined <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/api-development-services" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">API development services</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system ensures flexible and <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/agile-consulting" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">agile consulting services</a> by developing, deploying, and scaling microservices independently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microservices are similar to building blocks that are arranged in multiple ways to build <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-development" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">custom app solutions</a>. In this context, each microservice takes care of a specific task like user authentication, processing payments, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These integrations can be developed in various frameworks or programming languages. Additionally, they can even be hosted on multiple servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By microservices migration from monolithic apps, businesses can develop applications that are cloud-native, modern and can be scaled easily for changing business needs. These microservice applications will be:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scalable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resilient</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fault-tolerant</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilitate maintenance and updates smoothly</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamental goal of modernizing legacy applications is to preserve the functionality of the original application while breaking down a monolithic codebase into a group of microservices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That raises a question, how is that possible, given the complexity and lack of documentation of monolithic codes?</span></p>
<h2><strong>A Proven Approach for Refactoring Monolithic Codes to Microservices</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When researching modernizing monolithic applications, we found that Gartner has a three-step process of evaluation with </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-options-to-modernize-legacy-systems" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven options to modernize legacy systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from monolithic to microservices. Let’s explore them in detail.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40086 aligncenter" title="A Proven Approach for Refactoring Monolithic Codes to Microservices" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Proven-Approach-for-Refactoring-Monolithic-Codes-to-Microservices.jpg" alt="A Proven Approach for Refactoring Monolithic Codes to Microservices" width="800" height="333" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Proven-Approach-for-Refactoring-Monolithic-Codes-to-Microservices.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Proven-Approach-for-Refactoring-Monolithic-Codes-to-Microservices-300x125.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Proven-Approach-for-Refactoring-Monolithic-Codes-to-Microservices-768x320.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/A-Proven-Approach-for-Refactoring-Monolithic-Codes-to-Microservices-480x200.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>Step 1: Evaluate the Suitability of Your Legacy Systems</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to thoroughly assess the microservices architecture to understand whether is is suitable for your applications or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes evaluating the crucial players for adopting microservices, like scalability, agility, and fault tolerance. If your legacy application is not capable of offering these, the legacy application modernization becomes necessary to provide better value for your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, businesses also consider the complexity, cost, and security risk of their monolithic apps for evaluation. Modernization could be essential if you find complex technology and scalability for preventive costs.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Step 2: Evaluate your Legacy System</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have evaluated the problem, the next step is to analyze the application’s architecture to find out if it can be broken down into microservices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes using seven options to identify different components and modules of the application and their dependencies.</span><br />

<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40087 aligncenter" title="Evaluate your Legacy System" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Evaluate-your-Legacy-System.jpg" alt="Evaluate your Legacy System" width="800" height="393" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Evaluate-your-Legacy-System.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Evaluate-your-Legacy-System-300x147.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Evaluate-your-Legacy-System-768x377.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Evaluate-your-Legacy-System-480x236.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>1. Rehosting </b></span></h4>
<h5><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>What is it?</b></span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rehosting, also known as lift and sift migration, is moving the monolithic application to a new hosting environment. It can either be physical, virtual, or cloud migration. This does not require modifying the code, features, or functions.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rehosting approach can be considered when businesses wish to improve security, scalability, and reliability. Based on specific business requirements, it can be done on-premises or in the cloud.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>2. Refactoring</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refactoring is the approach of optimizing the current code to remove coding debt and improve non-functional features. In short, it includes restructuring the app’s code to a microservices architecture without making changes to its external behavior.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach can be used to improve application performance or make it feature-rich to increase the app’s value. This is a simple option as it does not require major changes; however, it can be time-consuming.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>3. Replatforming</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replatforming is an option for moving the monolithic application to a new runtime platform. When opting for this, you can make a few changes, but not to the code structure, features, and functionalities.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach can be used by businesses for modernizing monolithic applications for scalability enhancement and to improve application agility.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>4. Rearchitect</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, when using the rearchitect option to modernize monolithic applications, you modify the code to move it to a new application architecture and utilize new and better capabilities.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This option can be suitable for making your existing app more modular and scalable. Using this, you can deploy independently by breaking down your monolithic code into smaller and more manageable components. It can also help microservices to enhance agility.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>5. Rebuild</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebuild, also called redesign or rewrite. It is an option to rewrite the monolithic application from scratch using modern cloud-native technologies and frameworks, while preserving scope and specifications.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach helps businesses modernize existing applications while improving scalability, agility, and reliability. </span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>6. Encapsulate</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this option,<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/cloud-services/microservices-and-containerization" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"> microservices and containerization services</a> can be used to deploy as a single component of a smaller or independent module. Each module here can run in its container, providing scalability and flexibility compared to legacy architecture.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modernizing monolithic applications using containerization can make your application and its dependencies easy to manage. However, when using this approach, businesses may not fully take the benefits of microservices architecture.</span><b></b></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>7. Replace</b></span></h4>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is often considered as the final or last option. This approach, as the name suggests is replacing the monolithic application entirely with a new application using different and modern technologies and frameworks. The new application is usually built based on the new requirements and needs.</span></p>
<p><b>Why do it?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing will help businesses modernize the monolithic application to improve scalability and reliability. This involves using cloud-native technologies and adopting a microservice architecture.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Evaluate the Pros and Cons</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have finalized the modernization approach, it&#8217;s time to assess the pros and cons of adopting a microservices architecture. Some major benefits include enhanced scalability, agility, and fault tolerance. However, this could also lead to increased complexity and the need for new operational processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, modernizing monolithic applications finally comes down to selecting the right option based on the business’ needs. It is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of all the options and make a choice based on the desired result for the growth of your business.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand that having </span>eCommerce app development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not enough; you must also be well-skilled in managing offshore teams. Make sure you have a good understanding of </span>how to manage software development teams <span style="font-weight: 400;">and get the job done. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s discuss some of the right ways to </span>offshore development teams<span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business. </span></em></p>
<h2><strong> Identify Your Requirements</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses must focus on their requirements when </span>outsourcing software development<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to avoid setbacks. To make the right decision, businesses should clearly understand the type of team they need and the required skills. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a business developing an ecommerce website should look for the best companies. A </span>software development company in India <span style="font-weight: 400;">can offer you the expertise in creating robust ecommerce solutions at a reasonable cost. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team should also have experience integrating advanced payment gateways and features like SEO-friendly page structure, third-party integrations, and more. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By prioritizing their requirements, businesses can ensure that the chosen offshore ecommerce development team can deliver a high-quality product that meets their specific needs.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ensuring The Right Fit  </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is finding the right </span>offshore dedicated development team<span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business that understands your vision like you and actively works on the business goals. This can be done by clearly outlining the project requirements &amp; objectives. It includes the technology stack and language, budget, timeline, etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the experience &amp; expertise of the </span>offshore team<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in similar projects, their communication style, and their track record of success. It&#8217;s always a good idea to ask for references from former clients or customers to understand how reliable and successful the offshore team is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, test their skills before signing contracts to ensure they are the right fit. This could include having them complete a coding challenge or other assessment to evaluate their knowledge and abilities. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking these steps, you can be sure that you have chosen the right offshore partner for your eCommerce project and that they have the skills &amp; expertise necessary to deliver a great project.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Define Roles &amp; Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When hiring an </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ecommerce-development-services?utm_source=Web_blog%2830248%29&amp;utm_medium=Anu_B11&amp;utm_id=eCommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">offshore eCommerce app development company</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business, defining each team member&#8217;s roles &amp; responsibilities is essential. Doing this will help ensure they complete the project on time and to the highest standards. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, it helps in stating clearly what each</span> offshore team<span style="font-weight: 400;"> member is responsible for and makes them accountable for achieving them. This can help avoid any confusion or misunderstandings. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following are some typical roles &amp; responsibilities that need to be assigned: </span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Project Manager:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  A project manager manages your eCommerce development project. They oversee the budget, timeline, and deliverables and ensure the progress of your project as planned.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Developers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  A developer is the backbone of an </span>eCommerce development project <span style="font-weight: 400;">which not only writes the code but also implements the technical aspects of the project. They work closely with the technical lead to ensure the code is high quality and meets the project requirements.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>UX/UI Designer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The UX/UI designer will be responsible for the design &amp; user experience of your eCommerce website. They play a significant role in </span>eCommerce app development services <span style="font-weight: 400;">by creating attractive and engaging UX/UI designs for the website. Also, they are the ones who work closely with the technical lead and developers to implement the design correctly.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> QA analysts are responsible for ensuring the quality of the eCommerce website. They test the website for bugs, errors, and usability issues and work closely with the developers to resolve any problems.

</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Technical Lead:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Technical team is incomplete without its leader, so you would also need a technical lead for your project. A technical lead handles the technical aspects of the project. They ensure that the team follows the best practices and standards and oversees the eCommerce website&#8217;s design, development, and testing.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">

A business analyst understands the business requirements &amp; translates them into technical specifications. They work closely with the project manager, technical lead, and developers to ensure the eCommerce website meets the business requirements.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">

They ensure the website runs smoothly and addresses any issues arising after the launch. They are always available when for any challenges.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can ensure they develop the eCommerce website efficiently and effectively by assigning the right roles and responsibilities.

<li><b>Establish clear communication protocol: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define your communication protocols so the </span>offshore development team<span style="font-weight: 400;"> can understand your project’s goals and expectations.

<li><b>Assign a project manager</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: For better communication, you can assign a project manager who will act as a liaison between <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/cost-comparison-offshore-vs-onshore-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">onshore and offshore teams</a> and ensure effective communication.</span></li>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Encouraging Collaboration</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing your </span><b>offshore teams</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriately by sharing clear feedback to help them improvise and deliver what you expect.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While at the same time, giving your offshore development teams the freedom to work autonomously is essential. Allowing them to experiment, develop innovative solutions, and take ownership of the project can help foster a more collaborative environment that leads to tremendous success. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">For over two decades, offshore software development has been a mainstay of the global software development industry.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The demand for software development is increasing, and Offshore Software Development Centers (ODCs) have popped up in recent years to help startups and enterprises work with talented people worldwide. Also, the market size of IT outsourcing is expected to reach <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">$938 billion by 2027</strong>.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*xeHEE4q-6iyEHEA1" data-image-id="0*xeHEE4q-6iyEHEA1" data-width="600" data-height="300" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">The fundamental reasons for this are lower costs and access to a larger, more talented labor pool. You can also improve collaboration and optimize the management of your software development projects by setting up an ODC.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, setting up and managing an offshore development center (ODC) can be daunting. When setting up an offshore development center, you must stick to some basic principles.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In this blog, we will explain some essential elements of setting up an offshore development center. You can create a productive and efficient development center that meets your business needs by going through these principles.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">The offshore development center provides a complete solution for your software development needs. The offshore software development is the best of its class, where you get your requirements implemented without being dependent on any third party.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The ODC delivers the quality solution required to meet your business objectives. It is a novel and efficient business model that large IT product companies and startups can utilize.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, they are an excellent way for companies to reduce costs and establish their presence in countries with large skilled labor pools. You can also contact any </span>offshore outsourcing software development company<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to avail the benefits.</span></p>

<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Choose a location</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">When choosing a location for offshoring, it is essential to consider all aspects of the culture &amp; language preferences and the technical skills required.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Also, make sure that the vendor has expertise in helping you find what’s best suited to your project requirements.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can pick Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia to set up your ODC. Poland and Ukraine are big players in Easter Europe, and India is the giant in Asia. However, if you choose an <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-center-india" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">offshore software development company in India</a>,</strong> you will get exclusive benefits.</span></p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Find a trusted partner</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Not all business partners are equal when setting up an offshore development center. So try to find a good offshore software outsourcing company that can fulfill your project requirement.</p>

<hr />
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Technical Expertise</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">When choosing an offshore development firm, look at their portfolio and testimonials to see if they are the right person for your project.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Consider checking if they have industry expertise in addition to English fluency because this will help you ensure that you can meet all deadlines with success.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Cost flexibility</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Try to make sure you pay only for the services you hire from the offshore development center. Ask the vendor to give you the details like an invoice with transparent costing and a description of professionals and the work done.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Project Transparency</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">You must ask vendors to ensure transparency while working on your project. You can do so by asking for updates from time to time and by following proper communications and protocols.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Begin recruitment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">After partnering up with a service provider, lay the first stone of your recruitment process. At this point, researchers will start analyzing current labor markets and select eligible candidates to interview.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Find an office</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">While recruiters are busy interviewing the candidates, your next step should be to find an office workspace. Decide for security system, office planning, seats, equipment, parking area, etc.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You can also take the assistance of real estate managers who would be guiding you to find a suitable workspace for your future IT professionals.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Get legal support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">You can’t just go into a lease contract signing without hiring an experienced lawyer. So also, make sure you hire an experienced lawyer.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The lawyers will ensure that you are getting the best terms of the agreement. However, it takes a good understanding of the national law and profound negotiating skills.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Make procurements</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">To equip the new office, you need to procure furniture and proper IT infrastructure. So make sure it includes computers, software, security system, servers, etc.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Organize HR payroll</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">You need a person to organize HR payroll and accounting for your new offshore development center. This will support the functioning of operations while also making sure that you are aware of every step, including money transfers between ODC and head office.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Mistakes in Setting Up Offshore Development Center</h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Don’t Involve many recruitment agencies</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you decide to open an office abroad, most businesses feel it is good to involve at least two or three recruitment agencies in the local market. This way they can get more information and make their decision easier.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Unfortunately, this “excellent” plan seldom works and causes problems. A candidate can get interview calls from all recruitment agencies and be perplexed.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So, one ultimate solution is to keep it local by dealing directly with one recruitment agency who knows your company and the candidates inside out.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Don’t Ignore employer branding</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Employer branding can be a powerful tool in the recruitment process. If you want to accelerate your search, start with an employer brand campaign that focuses on how great working at this company would feel.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Unadaptable company policies</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">For many companies, their corporate HR policies work well with in-house teams but not necessarily those located offshore.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For this reason, you should be adaptable and discuss the vacation &amp; day off opportunities individually for each individual.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">No IP rights agreement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Hiring developers means you trust them with your intellectual property, but it’s essential to ensure they won’t leak any information.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So never forget to consult an IT lawyer before signing anything and protect yourself if something goes wrong.</p>

<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Cost-Effective</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Offshore development centers can be very cost-effective, as they often allow companies to outsource work at a lower price than they would be able to in their home country.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Additionally, companies can often save on office space and other related costs by having an offshore development center.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Access to Expertise</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Companies can <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers?utm_source=Hire_Dev&amp;utm_medium=Setup&amp;utm_campaign=web_blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_23807" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">hire developers</a> who are very experienced at the tasks they are working on. This can allow faster work because of previous experience with similar projects and better results.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, it allows companies to access development expertise that might not exist in their home country.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Access to Talent</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Hiring employees in an offshore development center allows companies looking for talented developers access to much larger pools of potential employees.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This can allow them to find the best person for the job, rather than just taking whoever they can find locally.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Further, it ensures that they always have access to talented developers, even if the talent pool in their home country is limited or non-existent.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">24/7 Operations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Because their employees are located in offshore development centers, companies can ensure round-the-clock operations. This can help them get more work done and make it easier for them to access customer support.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, having a 24/7 operation can make a company appear more reliable and professional overall.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Reliable Operations and Delivery</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">An offshore development center can allow companies to access reliable operations and guarantee that they will get the work done on time. This is because employees in offshore development centers are often more experienced, which means that they don’t require as much supervision.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Additionally, having a long-term relationship with their offshore development center allows companies to build trust and ensure that everything will go smoothly.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Better Focus on Vision and Strategy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">An offshore development center can be an excellent way for companies to focus on their vision and strategy. By outsourcing work to an offshore development center, companies can free up their employees to work on more crucial tasks.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This can ensure that employees are constantly working on high-priority tasks and don’t waste their time doing low-priority, lesser important work.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Increased Control</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">An offshore development center allows companies to have increased control over the work. Because, in most cases, they need to approve or supervise everything done in the development center. Managers can also access metrics and monitor work in real-time, which can help to ensure that everything is going smoothly.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Though having an offshore development center has many advantages like the above, it’s essential to be aware of the risks involved to ensure everything goes smoothly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This includes having a solid IP rights agreement in place and ensuring that the developers you hire are trustworthy.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Q 1 What kind of projects are most suitable for offshore development, big or small?</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There is no concrete answer to this question as it depends on each project’s specific needs and requirements.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, small projects are generally better suited for offshore development than large projects.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The reason is that small projects are less expensive and less time-consuming to develop and manage, so they are more feasible for a remote team of developers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Additionally, since the offshore team will coordinate with your in-house team, smaller projects will be easier to manage and monitor.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Larger projects can be more challenging to manage remotely, as there is often a greater need for communication and coordination between the client and the development team.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Additionally, large projects can be more costly and time-consuming to develop, making them less feasible for an offshore development team.</p>
<p class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Q 2 Why is the popularity of offshore software development growing so fast?</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The popularity of offshore software development is growing fast because it offers several advantages for companies, including:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lower costs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Offshore software development is often cheaper than hiring developers in-house or working with a traditional software development vendor.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Faster time to market</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Business can get their products to market faster by outsourcing the development process.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Greater scalability</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Companies can ramp up or down their offshore development resources as needed, making it easier to scale up or down their software development efforts.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Improved quality</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">By working with a team of developers who are experts in the specific technology used for your project, you can improve the quality and accuracy of your software.</p>
<p class="graf graf--h3"><strong>Q 3 What is the difference between building an ODC and outsourcing?</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The significant difference between building an ODC and outsourcing is that with an ODC, you own and control your data. Moreover, outsourcing services give up control to a third party.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">With an ODC, you are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the infrastructure. With outsourcing, the third party will design, build, and maintain the infrastructure for you.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Also, you are responsible for managing and securing your data with an ODC. With outsourcing, the third party controls and secures your data on your behalf.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">An ODC provides more autonomy and flexibility than outsourcing. An ODC can be tailored to meet your specific needs, whereas an outsourced system is likely to be one-size-fit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">Matching the changing pace of technologies and prospering the growth is the new face of business survival. Every passing day leads us to more advanced and trailblazing aspects of lifestyle through pioneering software development. From online shopping to taking online classes, from artificial intelligence to cryptocurrency, everything revolves around the digital ecosystem. Every effort of developers and programmers is to cater a soothing and hassle-free digital experience to every user.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/software-market-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Grand View Research</a>, the global software market size was estimated at USD 583.47 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.5% from 2023 to 2030.</p>
<p>Additionally, growing network security and privacy encourage company expansion. The COVID-19 epidemic had a favorable effect on the world market.</p>
<p>During COVID-19, businesses were encouraged to install software solutions and set up malware protection, recognition, and mitigation methods, which fueled the market&#8217;s expansion. This was due to growing worry about cyber threats.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">How Vast is The Digital World Ecosystem?</h2>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Software Development &amp; Developers Market</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The rapid advancement of technology makes this digital world more buzzing and more dynamic. And, software development acts as a fuel that drives our IT services at high speed.

<p class="graf graf--p">As always, the outline of software needs utmost attention to the end-user experience. However, digitalization compels industries to step forward to adopt cloud application services or SaaS (software as a service) to amplify user engagement. Although, the market still opens for other forms of software.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Cybercrime Data analysis</h3>
<p>According to a post by <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8475-cost-of-cyberattack.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business News Daily</span></a>, cybercrime is predicted to cost $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025</p>
<p>More user engagement makes data security more vulnerable and raises cybercrime concerns. <a href="https://www.fundera.com/resources/small-business-cyber-security-statistics" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60%</span></a>% of small businesses that are victims of a cyber attack go out of business within six months</p>
<p>On the surface, cybercrime is conducted in data theft, identity fraud, ransomware attacks, phishing campaigns, copyright infringement, etc. The consequences of these attacks can lead to data breaches.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/average-cost-healthcare-data-breach-11-million/688859/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a>, the average cost of a healthcare data breach rose to around $11 million in 2023, an increase of 8% from the previous year and a 53% increase from 2020.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-30912 size-full aligncenter" title="Screenshot from 2023 05 01 18 03 13" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13.png" alt="Screenshot from 2023 05 01 18 03 13" width="896" height="561" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13.png 896w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13-300x188.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13-768x481.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" /></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p>Every type of cybercrime leads us to data breaches, and hacking is one of the most common criminal activities on the internet.</p>
<p>Hackers exploit a weakness in online communication, digital networks, or computer systems and spread malware or gain unauthorized access to data to pursue criminal activities. All actions uplift the urgency of a robust defense system to stop cyber attacks.</p>
<p>While discussing data breaching, social media also is a massive center of attraction. However, many users are skeptical about the data being used.</p>
<p>Facebook received 64,148 requests for user information from US law enforcement agencies in the second half of 2022. Germany came in second with 17 thousand requests, followed by India with 63 thousand user data requests. A total of 239 thousand requests were made throughout the measurement period</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Web Application Vulnerabilities and Threats</h3>
<p>Misconfiguration in web application code allows hackers to get control over your website. That’s why the security of software development raises concerns to address web application vulnerabilities and threats.</p>
<p>The US government’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD) shares the case studies of cybercrimes of prominent organizations.</p>

<p>Increment of 20% in email-based attacks from 2019 to 2020 as compared to web attack vectors.</p>
<p>In 2019 and 2020, Emotet was the most heavily distributed malware family. It is a botnet responsible for the distribution of Trickbot, Qbot, and more, in some cases resulting in a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>XMRig is the most attacked cryptominer, whereas Lucifer is a self-propagating, multi-platform malware targeting Linux, IoT devices, and Windows web servers.<br />
Hiddad or ‘Hidden Ad’ tops the chart of mobile malware global analysis. Through this malware, attackers can easily fetch the details from victims’ mobile by displaying ads. During COVID, the malware disguised itself as a coronavirus information app for Arab speakers.<br />
In 2020, a team of developers took 280 days to identify a cyber breach that led to the loss of nearly $4 million.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">How To Approach Secure Software Development?</h2>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Cyberattacks and enhanced data security directs companies to think about secure software development. ValueCoders is India&#8217;s leading software <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>IT outsourcing company</strong></a> that continuously addresses defects to make secure software and reduce vulnerabilities. Divide software development lifecycle into different segments starting from requirements and move to other steps, designing, implementation, and testing.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The Software Engineering Institute developed the Team Software Process (TSP), allowing software developers and developer teams to create software under a definite process. This process wants companies to focus on:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Use common sense software engineering practices</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Tackle defects throughout the software product development lifecycle</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Use proper measurement to control the process</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Track the process and address defect prevention as well as removal</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Apply predictive measures for remaining defects</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Another significant example demonstrated by Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) practices. SDL practices support security assurance and compliance requirements and also reduce the severity of vulnerabilities in software development. As per Microsoft, software developers are suggested to follow various practices:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Providing training</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Define security requirements</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Define metrics and compliance reporting</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform threat modeling</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Establish Design requirements</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Define &amp; use cryptography</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Use third-party components to manage security<span style="font-weight: 400;"> risk</span></li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Use approved tools</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST)</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform Penetration Testing</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Establish a Standard Incident Response Process</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has ideas. But do we realize how difficult thriving, workable products or services? Indeed, a hard nut to crack. You need to be innovative while still delivering worth a penny.</p>
<p>According to McKinsey Global Institute data, only 1 out of 7 ideas result in a successful product, and the failure rates for newly launched products are between 25%-45%. Using a structured approach, you’ll stand a greater chance of avoiding any pitfalls resulting in your new product’s failure.</p>
<p>As said by late Apple founder Steve Jobs: “People are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involving customers at the early stage helps NPD process and understand their problem before executing ideas into process, tools, and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Necessity leads to invention. That’s where the New Product development Process(NDP) will help. A very simplified process to convert ideas into a tested concept into viable products and eliminate non-feasible ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where the </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/stages-of-new-product-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">new product development process (</a></strong>NDP<strong>)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes into play. This process is designed to aid the conversion of new and untested concepts into viable products and market them while allowing you to weed out non-feasible ideas.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Is New Product Development?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New product development is all about converting an idea into a business-strategic workable software development product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Product Development (NPD) process involves researching existing products in the market with a customer-centric approach, feasibility of the idea, delivering working software and latching on the market opportunities, and delivering working software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product development is an umbrella term that covers six stages of SDLC and working and has a POC. The</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Product Development</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">approach revolves around an entirely new idea, where the uncertainty around its development and the next option remains high. Software</span> product development companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">are progressively exploring NPD facets to address development glitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is about releasing the latest software product, you should seek services from leading </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software product development services</a><b>;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then, always a fair <strong>idea</strong> to join hands with leading firms.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 1: Idea Generation</b></h2>
<p><strong>Emphasize On Customer Problems: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good entrepreneur can scan the issues faced by the target audiences.  You can always identify the issues the customer is facing.</span></p>
<h3><strong>a) Personal Roadblocks</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or a buyer, the customer&#8217;s tendency always remains the same. All you need to do is prioritize one problem, derive a solution, and tag it” one for all. If you’re looking to set the tone right before product development, subscribing to </span>product design and development companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">could help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to apply your brain behind digital offerings. The communication gap often leads to many problems&#8212;&#8211; and is the biggest hurdle towards the path to productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a product and launching it can have some ups and downs, but there should focus on making up a great business idea.</span></p>
<h3><b>b) </b><b>Qualify Each Of The Listed Problems</b></h3>
<p><b>Here is the 4 U strategy:</b></p>
<p>Let’s discuss each of these aspects in detail.</p>
<p><b>Unworkable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out whether the brainstormed product concepts will address some real problems. Will the product be able to fill the existing customer experience gaps and will achieve product-market fit?</span></p>
<p><b>Unavoidable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the problem that you are working on inevitable to the extent that it becomes mandatory to comply? You need to find out whether solving that problem is a choice or a compulsion.</span></p>
<p><b>Urgent:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is the problem urgent and is highly demandable by the target market? If the answer is affirmative, this could be your chance to cover the white space in the market with your original product.</span></p>
<p><b>Underserved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there no available products that address the existing user problems? Look for the whitespace in the market and hold on to the idea that looks promising.</span></p>
<h3><b>c) </b><b>Emerging With Possible Solutions </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the problem gets figured out, you can start looking for possible solutions with a </span>product development firm <span style="font-weight: 400;">to produce feasible solutions. For every new user problem, there’ll be a new NPD service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have figured out the problem, it’s time to look for possible solutions. For every user problem, there ought to be potential new product development opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the workflow that starts from a problem and ends up with strategizing around the solution.</span></p>
<h3><b>d) Narrowing Down The Problems</b></h3>
<p>Categorize all shortlisted problems using a comparison chart with solutions<b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Circulate the findings across the organizational structure to come up with a viable problem set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case stakeholders are reserved, you can Replicate, Re-purpose, and with an upgrade approach.</span></p>
<p><b>Replicate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  You can create a similar product with. a competitor and launch it in the new market conditions. Once MVP(Minimum Viable Product) is launched, then you should prioritize out-of-the-box features.</span></p>
<p><b>Re-Purpose</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  You can rewire the existing business model and present it in the most viable manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It focuses on rewiring an existing business model—for instance, LinkedIn Learning &amp; e-learning platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Upgrading: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This concept of NPD revolves around the existing model with some improvements. Be it performance, speed, or addressing challenges of competitors with added functionalities. </span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 2: Idea Screening</b><b>      </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new product development stage is about choosing the idea that gives you the highest potential for success. You can put all your ideas collectively for internal review, i.e., seek the advice of people with industry knowledge and experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When developing a new product idea, leverage the advantage of POC (Proof of Concept) to check the feasibility of the concept. One can’t zero on an idea that is not technically feasible to build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can consult the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/on-demand-teams/why-startups-choose-dedicated-teams-for-agile-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Agile development teams</a>&#8212;&#8211;expertise helps understand the technical side of things and helps shortlist ideas worth building a PoC. In India, </span>software product development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> leading-age technology solutions give the prospects a smooth development experience</span></p>
<p><b>SWOT (</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities &amp; Threats</span><b>) </b>is prevalent and good practice while shortlisting New Product development ideas.</p>
<p>The agile development team, product owner, scrum master, and product manager go through a detailed analysis and shortlist ideas&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; opportunities and strengths, threats picture and weaknesses.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a SWOT is relatively simple, and you need a simple 2×2 grid to get started:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWOT Analysis Template | New Product Development</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, your New Product Development idea should be unique so that you do not have to convince people to pay for it.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 3: Concept Development &amp; Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluation of value proposition is the first step towards testing and development. It ensures you assess the problem in advance and can course-correct earlier. It saves from piling new technical debts.</span></p>
<p><b>These steps easy-to-follow steps include :</b></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantifying gain/pain Ratio</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a competitor analysis </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enlisting major product features</span></li>

<h2><b>Stage 4: Value Proposition Strategy </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great asset of </span>product development companies in India <span style="font-weight: 400;">before they launch any product. You should be very particular about the capabilities of new products. Once you are good to go with the idea’s utility, you can pitch it clearly to the end-user. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It ensures that a product or service positions around customer exact values and needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the form of a </span>value proposition<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can showcase what your product is capable of doing.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20135" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.png" alt=" value proposition" width="566" height="276" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.png 850w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4-300x146.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4-768x374.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<h2><b>Stage 5:Concept Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are ready with the proposition in </span>software product development<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can now present it to the set of selected customers. The key is to have trust and belief in your ideas. Since the concept doesn’t look promising, you’ll repeat steps to develop a new project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get meaningful insight by focusing on four critical aspects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identification of the focus group, i.e., people who would benefit from the new product under development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessment of other alternatives to be offered to the focus group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Devising a foolproof plan for the New Product Development right from features, marketing, pricing, and distribution</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integration of unique product features into the customer’s mind for findability and discoverability.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Stage 6: Product Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span>product development software companies<span style="font-weight: 400;"> start, execution of ideas occurs, the business strategy is documented &#8212;- you can go ahead with the product development cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Product Development starts with developing the prototype followed by MVP.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Prototype</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creation of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/product-ui-ux-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">UI/UX of the product</a> and share with the stakeholders helps visualize the product’s feasibility in the marketplace.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</b></h3>
<p>Using Agile for the new products gives a different look.  Once the product goes through the design &amp; steps &#8212; the product gets launched with minimal features.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile Product development is better than conventional. The waterfall model complements the to-and-fro movement across the development cycle and ideal for last-time changes.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20137" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.png" alt="" width="435" height="326" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Maintaining Communication &amp; Synchronization are the key highlights of Agile Model</b></p>
<h2><b>Stage 7: Market Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps in New Product Development aims to reduce the uncertainty revolving around the </span>software product development<span style="font-weight: 400;">, i.e., checking the viability of the new product or its marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>There are two market testing strategies to follow:</b></p>
<h3><b>1. Alpha Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of testing allows testing engineers to judge any product based on performance and map the marketing mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of any issues, the changes are planned and implemented before the final go-ahead.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Beta Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selected group of customers gives unbiased feedback to the organization. It is all about listening to customers’ voices when issuing a move back to the development team for fixtures.</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s how Alpha and Beta testing are different from each other:</b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20139" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf.png" alt="" width="513" height="471" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf.png 750w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /></p>
<p>The third form of testing conveyed product validation and is called In-Home Usage Test (IIHUT). Development products are meant for intended customers who will use the products.</p>

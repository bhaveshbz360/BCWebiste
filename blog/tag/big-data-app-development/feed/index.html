										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world where online retailers like Amazon are soaring to new heights, brick-and-mortar stores grapple with staying afloat. The key to survival lies in understanding customers like never before and meeting their needs with precision and finesse. This is where the transformative power of Big Data Analytics in the Retail Industry emerges as a savior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many retailers are embracing the cutting-edge tools of big data analytics to unveil invaluable insights about their customers and shopping habits. By doing so, they not only enhance their existing customer base but also draw in fresh patrons, boosting revenue and reshaping the retail landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent groundbreaking study conducted by </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/big%20data%20the%20next%20frontier%20for%20innovation/mgi_big_data_exec_summary.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that leveraging big data analytics could elevate retail operating margins by a staggering </span><b>60 percent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The potential lies in unlocking the goldmine of knowledge hidden within vast data sets, arming businesses with the know-how to make well-informed decisions, and elevating the shopping experience to uncharted heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the retail industry witnesses an unprecedented shift, the allure of big data analytics has ensnared the attention of retail marketers. This rapidly growing trend fuels the relentless pursuit of data-driven strategies to revamp marketing efforts and steer businesses toward unparalleled growth. In this riveting blog, we explore the myriad advantages of Big Data Analytics in the Retail Industry and unveil how these businesses are boldly transforming their destinies through the power of data.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Before starting this, let’s seek the expectations of a retail business from big data analytics …</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this modern era, many companies have set the wrong goals for their big data analytics projects and failed to succeed in the long run. Have a look at some important goals below:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Improve Customer Experience</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data gather customer insights and then uses those insights to improve the customer experience. For example, retailers can use big data to understand what customers say about them online and use that information to improve their products or services.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Increase Sales</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data identifies trends and patterns that further increase sales. For example, retailers can use big data to understand what products are selling well and stock more of those items.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Improve Operational Efficiency</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data helps streamline operations and make them more efficient. For example, retailers can use big data to track inventory levels and change their stock management processes accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Reduce Costs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data identify areas where costs can be reduced. For example, retailers can use big data to understand where they are overspending and then adjust their budgets accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If retail businesses keep these goals in mind, they will be more likely to get the most out of their big data analytics projects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers are no longer trying to predict what you might be interested in buying. User behavior is being looked at to know what they want.

<h3><strong>Easy and Cheaper Storage Facility</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data is becoming easier to store, with storage space becoming cheaper daily. Now, you can invest in ample data storage on a large scale. Managing the data effectively and making it useful for analytics is the core focus for retailers at this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the exact preferences of the consumer is now possible with big data solutions. The return on investment shoots up considerably with increased personalization for the consumer. Since consumers are interested in offers and discounts, so they do not find sharing their details difficult.

<h3><strong>Provides Targeted Communication To Customers</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalized marketing is 20% more effective with ‌Big Data Services than traditional marketing practices. Data analysis helps companies track the buying process and capture past purchases of customers, which they use to target them with personalized communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot has changed in retail since manufacturers started using data to make their products better tailored towards specific demographics or needs; now, it’s not uncommon that marketers will crack open your credit card history before jumping into an online checkout flow!</span></p>
<h3><strong>Predicts Demand And Managing Inventory</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data analytics and Big Data development enable retail companies to understand the customers’ buying needs and focus on areas with high demand. The conclusion derived from the data has helped many retailers. They better understand what their target audience wants to strategically plan out the inventory levels — keeping themselves ahead in this fast-paced industry.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Optimizes The Price</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retailer stage depicts the price of a product that gradually reduces after demand has subsided. However, it becomes more effective if you don’t reduce your prices during off-season periods or timeframes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using big data analytics, retailers can track customer spending patterns and preferences to gauge the prices most appeal to their customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can also use big data analytics to track inventory levels and sales rates to ensure they are not overstocking or understocking products.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you want to leverage the perks of all of this booming trend, you can embrace <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/big-data-application-development-services-company?utm_source=big_data_dev&amp;utm_medium=Big+Data+Analytics&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_27064" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>Big Data development services</strong></a> in upcoming years. However, embracing it as soon as possible is admissible to gain competitive advantages.</p>
<h3><strong>Enhances Customer Experience</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data analytics helps retailers analyze how customers shop and use this data to produce a seamless customer experience. From choosing the product and updating account details like shipping address or payment method, all these tasks become easier with Data Analytics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many companies nowadays make it easy for their clients through convenience features. It features within each platform they provide access to, such as online order processing, where you can select from available options before buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, you can buy without entering personal information besides what’s already there. Plus, just check out quickly by providing basic info about yourself (like Order ID) if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process saves time and effort in re-entering new data with allocation at other places during busy work schedules.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Retain Customers</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retaining customers is not an easy task. It requires constant attention and focuses on what will keep them interested in your brand. It requires how you can engage with their needs or interests long-term. In this way, they become loyal patrons of yours instead of someone who spends time elsewhere doing business (sleepless nights).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data analysis helps identify those people who disengage by identifying patterns. An example of this includes frequent buying habits. These insights give retailers insight into introducing offers that may interest the customer to make purchases again while retaining current ones.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Intelligence and Big Data are the two key players in the world of data processing. Big Data and BI are two different processes that occupy unique roles in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BI aims to collect, clean, and enrich structured or semi-structured data and then store it in different SQL databases. Data from various sources is stored in a data warehouse. Its goal is to support business decision-making with reports and dashboards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">To clear up your doubts once and for all, look at the given infographic:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Infographic Showing Big Data VS Business Intelligence War:</span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/business-intelligence-consulting-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-19041 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Big-Data-VS-Business-Intelligence.png" alt="business intelligence consultant, business intelligence consultants, business intelligence consulting, business intelligence consulting companies" width="790" height="5458" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Big-Data-VS-Business-Intelligence.png 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Big-Data-VS-Business-Intelligence-148x1024.png 148w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Big-Data-VS-Business-Intelligence-768x5306.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></a></h2>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><b>Top 3 Open Source BI Tools:</b></span></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>BIRTH:</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIRT was first launched in 2004 and is an open-source analytics platform that helps produce visually appealing reports.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>JasperReport:</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written entirely in Java, JasperReport is one of the most prominent and widely-used open-source reporting tools and can use data from any type of data source.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>KNIME:</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KNIME is an open-source </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/microsoft-power-bi-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>business intelligence testing</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool that integrates various data mining and machine learning components. The data can be enriched with the help of various business extensions that can be used here.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As its name suggests, Big Data refers to extremely large data sets that will be complex to manage with conventional databases. In Big Data, we often talk about the 3Vs theorized by Gartner, which are volume, speed, and variety.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong evolution of the masses of data, the speed at which your data travels, and the diversity of its sources will push us to use powerful tools to exploit all the data for better decision-making.</span></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><b>Top 3 Open Source Big Data Tools:</b></span></h2>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Hadoop:</b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Created by Apache, Hadoop is an open-source software framework that facilitates the distributed processing of a multitude of data sets across hundreds of servers that operate accordingly. Many companies have been using Hadoop for a long time to sort and analyze big data.</span></p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Open Refine:</b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenRefine is an open-source data management and visualization tool that enables you to quickly clean data sets and transform them into a workable format. Even non-technical users can use this solution. OpenRefine also allows you to create links between data sets instantly.</span></p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cassandra:</b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable NoSQL database. You can monitor large data sets across multiple server clusters and in the cloud. Originally developed by Facebook to meet the need for a database powerful enough for the inbox search function.</span></p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Conclusion:</b></h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big data big picture won&#8217;t replace your existing BI system, but it does provide unique opportunities if you manage to combine the richness of both technologies. It will expand your data view, allowing you to analyze much more detailed and complete data.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s begin by understanding what exactly Agile software development is and how adopting Agile principles can significantly reduce time to market, give businesses a competitive edge, and reduce time to market to drive success.</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding Agile Software Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile methodology is defined as the popular approach in the field of software development that mainly focuses on collaboration, flexibility, and customer-centricity. It focuses on iterative progress through small, manageable increments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/on-demand-teams/why-startups-choose-dedicated-teams-for-agile-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">dedicated Agile teams</a></strong> to adapt to changing requirements &amp; deliver value to customers more quickly &amp; efficiently.</span></p>
<h3><b>Key Principles &amp; Values of Agile</b><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-41126" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile.png" alt="Key Principles &amp; Values of Agile" width="748" height="397" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-300x159.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-768x407.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Key-Principles-Values-of-Agile-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is the list of key principles involved in Agile software development:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Iterative Development:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Agile methodology promotes breaking down the software development process into smaller i.e. iterative sprints or iterations. Each iteration involves designing, planning, developing, and testing a small functionality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Collaboration: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Agile&#8217;s core values is fostering close collaboration among cross-functional teams. Developers, testers, designers, and stakeholders work together during the entire project. They also ensure everyone is aligned &amp; contribute expertise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Flexibility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile teams often adjust their plans quickly and priorities as project requirements evolve based on customer feedback or market changes. This type of flexibility helps respond to new insights without disrupting the overall project flow.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Focus on Customers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Agile emphasizes delivering value to the customer. Agile teams also ensure that the final software product meets users&#8217; needs &amp;expectations. This iterative feedback loop helps refine features and functionalities based on real-world usage and feedback.</span></li>

<h3><b>Comparison with Traditional Software Development Methods</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By comparing Agile approach with other traditional methods, it will become clear how Agile&#8217;s adaptive &amp; responsive nature can accelerate time to market. This will ensure that the software effectively meets user needs &amp; market demands.</span></p>
<p><b>1. <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/agile-vs-waterfall-which-software-methodology-is-best-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Agile vs Waterfall</a>:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional software development methods i.e. the Waterfall model, follow a linear &amp; sequential approach. Each phase (in terms of requirements, design, development, testing, and rapid deployment) must be completed before moving towards the next. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This further leads to long development cycles and challenges accommodating changes once a phase is completed.</span></p>
<p><b>2. Predictability vs. Flexibility:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">While traditional methods offer predictability &amp; structured planning, they often lack the flexibility to adapt to these changes. Conversely, Agile embraces change &amp; uncertainty. This allows teams to pivot and make adjustments as needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes Agile particularly well-suited for projects with evolving requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Feedback Cycles:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In traditional methods, feedback typically comes late in the process, often during the testing phase or after deployment. Agile incorporates regular feedback throughout the development cycle, enabling continuous improvement and early identification of issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reduces the risk of major problems emerging late in the project.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Importance of Time to Market for Businesses</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a flexible framework, <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>custom mobile app development</strong></a> software can scale alongside the growth of a business. Custom software can handle more users, transactions, or data without slowing down. This means it stays strong and dependable even as the business grows, laying a solid foundation for long-term success.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Enhanced Flexibility for Agility</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software lets businesses change and grow as per the market. They can add, change, or remove features easily, keeping up with what customers want. This flexibility helps businesses grab new opportunities and change their strategies quickly, staying innovative and competitive.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Seamless Integration with Existing Systems</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software fits smoothly with other systems of business, making everything work together better. This means data and communication flow easily between different parts of the organization, breaking down barriers and making things run more smoothly. With everything connected, teams can work together more easily, saving time and effort and making the whole business more efficient.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Cost Efficiency in the Long Run</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although custom software development might seem more expensive at first compared to off-the-shelf options, it can save a lot of money in the long run. With custom software, businesses don&#8217;t have to pay expensive fees for licenses as they do with other software. Plus, they don&#8217;t have to rely on outside companies for help or maintenance as much, which also saves money over time.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Competitive Advantage through Differentiation</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software helps businesses stand out in the market by offering special features, personalized experiences, and new ideas. This makes customers want to choose them over other companies and keeps them coming back. By using custom software to provide excellent service and value, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and keep growing successfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By investing in custom software, companies can improve their operations, be more flexible, and do better than their competition in today&#8217;s changing business world.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Considerations When Developing Custom Software</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When planning to develop custom software, it&#8217;s important to think about a few key things to make sure it turns out well. Here are some important factors to think about:</span><b></b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40693" title="" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development.png" alt="Key Considerations of Custom Software development" width="860" height="715" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development.png 860w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development-300x249.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development-768x639.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Considerations-of-Custom-Software-development-480x399.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Clear Understanding of Requirements</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting the software development process, it&#8217;s crucial to understand its purpose thoroughly. This involves extensive discussions with stakeholders to determine their needs and expectations. Gathering this information upfront ensures the software will meet all the organization&#8217;s requirements and goals.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Budgeting and Resource Allocation</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making custom software takes a lot of time and money. It&#8217;s important to set a budget that makes sense and use resources well to keep the project on schedule and meet its goals on time. By being careful with how money and time are spent, organizations can avoid spending more than planned and make sure the project goes well.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Choosing the Right Development Partner</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right company to build the software is really important for the project to go well. Find a company that&#8217;s well-known for making good custom software. Consider points like how much they know, how long they&#8217;ve been doing it, and if they fit well with your organization&#8217;s way of doing things. A reliable company can offer helpful insights, advice, and support, ensuring smooth and successful results.</span><b></b></p>

<hr />
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Technology Stack</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking the right tools and technology is another important consideration. Choose the ones that match the project&#8217;s needs, like how big it might get and what it needs to do in the future. Also, think about ease of integration, security, and support, when evaluating technology options. By using the right technology, organizations can make strong, flexible software that works well now and in the future.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Agile Development Methodology</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using agile methods while making custom software can keep the project flexible and ready to change if needed. Agile development in software engineering encourages working together, being open, and making things better bit by bit. This means the software can get better quickly and be ready to use sooner. By being agile, organizations can listen to feedback, fix things that aren&#8217;t right, and make sure the software does what people need it to do.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h3><b>Testing and Quality Assurance</b></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thorough <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-quality-assurance-testing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software testing and QA services</a></strong> are essential factors of the custom enterprise software development process. Use strong testing methods to find and fix any bugs, errors, or usability issues before launching the software to real potential users. By emphasizing quality assurance throughout the development process, organizations can be sure that the final product meets the ultimate standards of performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a software product is an exciting journey that involves proper planning, construction, implementation, and patience when it is finally released to the market. Considering the competition in today&#8217;s rapidly changing and fast-paced business world, it is essential to launch your product as soon as possible, and you can achieve this by starting with the development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This blog aims to provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to create a complete software product from MVP app development. We will cover everything from identifying your target audience to scaling and growth.</span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<h2><b>What Is MVP?</b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_29807" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-29807" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-29807" title="What is an MVP" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-is-an-MVP_.jpg" alt="What is an MVP" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-is-an-MVP_.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-is-an-MVP_-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-is-an-MVP_-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-29807" class="wp-caption-text">What is an MVP</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP stands for &#8220;Minimum Viable Product. It is a product designed to help you learn about and test your business idea before you build a final product. The product has enough features to meet the needs of early adopters and get the valuable feedback that can be used to upgrade the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several things to keep in mind when building an MVP startup:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your product is simple enough to test quickly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep track of how many users use your product and make changes based on their feedback. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on what your users need most right now either </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/product-ui-ux-design?utm_source=ValueCoders+-+mvp-to-full-fledged-product&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">product UI/UX design services</a> or product consulting services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t over complicate or add more features until you have validated what they actually needed.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Importance Of MVP In Product Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP software development is a proven approach for testing your product idea and validating your market before committing to a full-fledged product. It is a stripped-down version of a product that includes essential features &amp; functionalities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP app development is becoming increasingly popular among businesses nowadays for the many benefits that can make or break the success of your product.</span></p>

<h3><b>Validate Product Idea</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP software development is an ideal way to cost-effectively evaluate the success potential of a product concept. With its minimal version, one can obtain customers&#8217; insight and remarks that can be used to better the product and ensure it fulfills the desired users&#8217; requirements.</span></p>
<h3><b>Faster time-to-market</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP accelerates the product development process and gets the product out in the market faster. By solely focusing on the essential features, teams can launch a product in no time. Hence, it is a great advantage in today&#8217;s cut-throat markets, where the first-mover gets the most.</span></p>
<h3><b>Saves time &amp; money</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a complete product may require a considerable investment of resources. By using the MVP strategy, businesses can analyze the viability of an idea without dedicating too much time and funds to it. In this way, they can concentrate on essential components rather than adding excessive components.</span></p>
<h3><b>Builds a Community</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP app development can assist in the creation of an early adopter community that is enthusiastic about the product. This group can supply beneficial advice, help promote the item, and potentially create a new consumer base.</span></p>
<h3><b>Better User Experience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teams need to garner feedback from early adopters in product development to fine-tune the user experience and ensure that the product is attractive to the target audience. Making required changes during this time ensures a successful outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, MVP in product development is an impressive way to validate your ideas, save time &amp; money, improve user experience, and build a community of new product adopters. Furthermore, it helps you know your potential users and how the product is positioned for success in the long run.</span></p>

<h3><b>Understanding Your Target Audience</b></h3>
<p>The first step in building a full-fledged product from an MVP is to fully understand your target audience. Some best ways to follow while having a good understanding of your customers are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying people who will be using your product by conducting online surveys or via interviews</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathering data on their needs and preferences</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting market research to validate your product ideas</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To become successful in this process, it is essential to be comprehensive. You need to ensure sufficient time to familiarize yourself with your consumers, the obstacles they face, and the aspects they need in a product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These insights will be an indispensable asset as you create your MVP and refine your product scheme.</span></p>

<h3><b>Developing The MVP</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you understand your target audience, it is the right time to build your MVP. This involves defining the MVP&#8217;s core features, choosing the right MVP app development method, and building and testing the MVP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should focus on the core features that will help you achieve your goals. Also, avoid adding too many features too soon, which can slow down the development process and result in a cluttered product.</span></p>
<p><b>Here, we have listed steps that will help you get started with MVP software development:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Choose a pain point that your customers are experiencing.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Figure out who your target market is.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Research what other <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/startup-consulting-services?utm_source=ValueCoders+-+mvp-to-full-fledged-product&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">product consulting services</a> solve the same problem or pain point as yours.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Create a rough prototype of your product and test it with potential customers.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Refine and perfect your product based on customer feedback.</span></li>

<h3><b>Building the Full-Fledged Product</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing a full-fledged product from an MVP seems an impossible task. After all, your final product should make your customers happy. For this, you need to follow the step-by-step instructions listed below:</span></p>
<p><b>Define Your Product Vision &amp; Goals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must have a clear idea of your product&#8217;s purpose and its advantages for the users. An explicit understanding of the product will enable the creation of features tailored to customer demands.</span></p>
<p><b>Analyze Your Competition</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure you provide customers with the features they need, it&#8217;s essential to explore the competition and appraise their features. Researching this before beginning product development enables you to tailor features based on customer insights rather than just guesses.</span></p>
<p><b>Create A User Persona </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will provide insights into the needs of the intended users and allow you to prioritize the features according to these requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>Develop Wireframes &amp; Prototypes</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an in-depth understanding of your product&#8217;s capabilities, the next step is to create wireframes and prototypes to test its feasibility and confirm usability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to listen to customer feedback and make changes based on their needs. This will help you build a product that meets the needs of your target audience and is well-received in the market.</span></p>
<h3><b>Launching the MVP</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you have a full-fledged product developed, and it&#8217;s time to launch. This involves</span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing the MVP to potential customers </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathering feedback  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving the MVP app development</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing is a key component of this step. Hence, ensure you have a well-thought-out marketing strategy in place and take advantage of all the marketing channels available.</span></p>
<h3><b>Scaling and Growth</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you scale and grow your product, you need to keep an eye on your product’s key metrics and continuously improve it based on customer feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This step involves the following things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing a scalable infrastructure</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a strong brand and marketing strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding the product to new markets</span></li>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyze the size of the team and see what types of skills they possess.</span></li>

<h3><strong>Common Hiring Models For Dedicated Development Team </strong></h3>
<p>Here are some of the most common hiring models for dedicated development teams to help you make an informed decision for your next project.</p>
<p>1. Dedicated Team Model (DTM): In the DTM, you hire an entire team of software developers, designers, <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/latest-trends-of-qa-engineers-hiring-what-to-look-for-before-hiring-qa-engineers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>QA engineers</strong></a> and other specialists who work exclusively on your project.<br />
The team becomes an extension of your in-house workforce, collaborating with your internal teams seamlessly. Additionally, it offers flexibility, scalability, and complete control over the development process.</p>
<p>2. Time and Material (T&amp;M): This model involves paying for the actual time and resources invested in your project. T&amp;M model provides transparency, and you are billed for the hours worked and the materials used. It suits projects with evolving requirements and scope changes, as you can easily adjust the team size and workload</p>
<p>3. Fixed-Price Model: In a fixed-price model, you and the development company agree on a fixed budget for the entire project. Suitable for well-defined projects with stable requirements, as changes might lead to additional costs.<br />
&#8211; This model provides predictability in costs, making it easier to plan budgets.</p>
<p>4. Retainer Model: In a retainer model, you pay a recurring fee to reserve a certain number of hours per month from the development team. It works well for ongoing maintenance, support, or periodic updates to existing projects.You maintain flexibility while having a dedicated team at your disposal whenever you need them.</p>
<p>5. Project-Based Model: With the project-based model, you hire a dedicated team to work on a specific project with a defined scope and timeline. Once the project is completed, the team is disbanded or moved to other tasks. This model is suitable for short-term projects with clear objectives.</p>
<p>6. Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT): The BOT model involves outsourcing the development initially, and later, transferring the team to your company&#8217;s ownership. It&#8217;s a strategic choice when you plan to establish your development center in the long run.This model provides an opportunity to evaluate the team&#8217;s capabilities before committing to permanent employment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Famous Models To Hire A Dedicated Development Team</strong></span></p>

<h2><strong>Benefits of Hiring A Dedicated Development Team</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many advantages to hiring a dedicated development team, including:</span></p>
<p><strong>1. – Increased Efficiency:</strong> A dedicated development team will work more efficiently because they solely focus on your project and will be familiar with your company’s specific needs and requirements. This can cause faster turnaround times and fewer errors.</p>
<p><strong>2. Increased Flexibility:</strong> You can quickly scale up or down a dedicated development team depending on your project’s needs, saving you money in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>5. Less Management:</strong> You don’t need to spend time or deal with day-to-day management issues often present in on-site staffing.</p>
<p><strong>6. Qualified Hand-Picked Developers:</strong> It gets you a team of highly trained professionals that has undergone various evaluations and interviews to show that they are qualified.</p>
<p><strong>7. Cost-cutting Techniques:</strong> You can use strategies for cost-cutting, like changing the number of team members at any point in the development process.</p>
<p><strong>8. Complete Control of Development:</strong> The entire developmental process is directly in your hands, so you can modify the existing process or invent something new at any stage of development.</p>
<p><strong>9. No Risk of Data Breach:</strong> Hiring a dedicated development team minimizes the risk of a data breach since most of them guarantee intellectual property protection and data security and sign any related agreements legally.</p>
<h2><strong>Cons of Hiring A Dedicated Development Team</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cons of hiring a dedicated development team are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1 &#8211; It’s Time-Consuming to Find and Screen Candidates<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll need to find the right team, interview candidates, and check references.</span></p>
<p><strong>2 &#8211; Inefficient for Short-term Projects</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team model is inefficient for short-term projects since members need to adapt to the project requirements, which consumes time and reduces efficiency.</span></p>
<p><strong>3 &#8211; Difficult Cost Estimation</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is difficult to do the right cost estimation because of variations in the number of team members and project requirements.</span></p>
<p><strong>4 &#8211; Lack of in-person Communication</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When teams are in the same physical space, it&#8217;s much easier for them to communicate and collaborate. Without this in-person interaction, it can be difficult for team members to build trust and rapport with one another, which can hinder their ability to work effectively together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miscommunication can easily occur when team members cannot physically talk to each other. This can lead to team members&#8217; frustration and cause project timelines delays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after knowing the pros and cons of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/top-benefits-hiring-dedicated-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>hiring a dedicated web development team</strong></a>, it becomes difficult to decide when to hire and when not to hire dedicated software developers.</span></p>

<h3><strong>When You Should Hire A Dedicated Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring a team of dedicated developers is idle for complex and lengthy projects that might expand in the future.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Lack of expertise:</strong> When there is a lack of expertise in-house, it might be more efficient to outsource development work to a dedicated team. For example, if your company does not have experience developing mobile apps, hiring a team specializing in mobile app development would be more cost-effective.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Lack of resources</strong>&#8211; It might make sense to hire a dedicated team when there are insufficient resources or the budget for internal development. For instance, if your company does not have the manpower or the financial resources to develop an e-commerce platform in-house, it would be more practical to outsource the project to a team of experts.</span></li>
<li><b>Limited Development Budget &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if your development budget is limited, then hiring a dedicated team may be more affordable than contracting out work individually.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>When Should You Not Hire A Dedicated Development Team?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few conditions when you should not hire a dedicated development team. Some of those conditions are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Lack of development or marketing budget</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; You should not hire a dedicated team if you do not have a development or marketing budget. A dedicated team requires both human and financial resources to be successful, and without these resources, it is unlikely that the team will achieve its goals.</span></li>
<li><b>Lack of tools and support &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You should not hire a dedicated team if you cannot provide them with the tools and support they need to do their job. A good example of this would be if your company does not have an email system or if you do not have an adequate IT infrastructure in place. Without these basic tools, it would be difficult for the team to function properly.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After knowing the conditions of hiring or not hiring a dedicated development team, let’s now check the cost of hiring a dedicated development team.</span></p>

However, the geolocation you choose greatly affects the price of hiring the team. Asia offers better prices, and you can get your work done in high quality at half the price. </span></p>

Let&#8217;s dive in!</p>
<h2><strong>What is IT Staff Augmentation?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some ways, IT staff augmentation is like outsourcing. A company hires and takes advantage of employees&#8217; talent from an outside staffing firm that focuses on providing services to meet your company&#8217;s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a few key differences between IT staff augmentation and outsourcing set them apart. Outsourcing can be more cost effective because you only pay for what you need when needed, but it’s not as customizable or personalized as </span>IT Staff Augmentation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As organizations struggle to keep up with technological innovations and adapt to new practices, it&#8217;s not surprising that IT staffing needs are constantly changing. Keeping up-to-date on new technologies and finding professionals with the right skills to work at your company can be daunting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are many ways in which you can meet your staffing needs while ensuring those workers stay satisfied and engaged in their roles. One of the most effective methods is IT staff augmentation.</span></p>
<h2>Types of Staff Augmentation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many IT staff augmentations are available, we can categorize them into three types. Here’s a quick rundown of each category:</span></p>
<p><b>Commodity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These are staff augmentation tasks that freelance contractors can easily and quickly handle. A quick search for a freelancer will turn up dozens of qualified candidates within minutes. There is usually no interview process to find the perfect person for the job. If you have one-time projects and need someone on your team to complete them, commodity staff augmentation is perfect.</span></p>
<p><b>Non-commodity:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Non-commodity IT staff augmentation tasks are more in-depth and require skills or knowledge that are hard to find. If you’re looking for a specialized skill set, such as someone who knows how to design websites, you’ll probably have to conduct an extensive search, even if it means hiring someone full-time.</span></p>
<p><b>Skill-based</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Skill-based staffing is used when a business needs to fill an open position with a skill set it doesn&#8217;t currently have on its payroll. There are often high barriers to entry for these positions because these skills are hard to find, so staffing agencies may require potential employees to take tests or prove their qualifications before being considered.</span></p>
<p><b>Highly Skilled</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: High-skilled staff augmentation falls into short-term and long-term categories. Short-term is what it sounds like, workers who come in for short periods (often weeks) while your regular team takes a vacation. Long-term hires typically stay on your payroll full-time, but you cannot handle 100% of their workload. They work as support while your regular team handles the heavier stuff.</span></p>

<h2>Why Hire an External Support Team?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rely on an external support team for your IT needs when you need a more consistent and personalized level of service. When staff augmentation is in place, your company will be more productive because it&#8217;s free from responsibilities that take up valuable time and energy.<br />
These IT staff augmentation services come in many flavors, but the common denominator among them is the type of commitment they provide to the customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can hire either onsite or remote employees. Both have advantages and disadvantages, depending on your business needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onsite staff augmentation means working with IT support professionals in your company&#8217;s office space. It gives them a direct line of sight into what&#8217;s happening with your network and your technology infrastructure to address the issues quickly and immediately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote staff augmentation means they work from another location outside of your office space, usually at home or in a co-working facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onsite staff augmentation is more expensive, but it gives you direct access to your support professionals. You can also choose when and how you would like to have their assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With remote staff augmentation, IT services are cheaper overall because there is no cost associated with office space or equipment that a contractor must use. However, these workers often require more oversight because they aren&#8217;t sitting in front of your company&#8217;s network daily.</span></p>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will spend more time managing business and less time managing equipment, networks, and software updates.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get assistance with ongoing and sporadic projects that require a little more time &amp; attention than others.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be able to ensure consistency in the quality of your business services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There will be no more creative blocks, as you will be able to bring in fresh ideas, insights, and creativity to your business.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing IT staff augmentation services enables you to focus on your core competencies.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT staff augmentation services mean there is no need to recruit, train or manage in-house IT professionals as the outsourced company does.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an issue occurs, then somebody at hand can quickly deal with it and get things back up and running again, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about expensive downtime or loss of productivity.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll also save money on recruitment costs as the augmented staff will handle any unexpected issues with minimal disruption to your day-to-day work, which means you&#8217;ll avoid costly hiring mistakes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right IT staff augmentation service can help you focus on long-term goals, so your business always works at its best.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT Staff augmentation can provide the expert knowledge that is difficult to find elsewhere. With the right service providing all these benefits and more, it&#8217;s not hard to see why they&#8217;re becoming increasingly popular.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making sure you select the right one is vital. However, some providers may offer their skills at a fixed price, whereas others may charge hourly rates.</span></li>

<hr />
<h2>What if Your Company Already Has A Strong In-house Technology Department?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your company already has a strong in-house technology department, there is still good reason to hire an outsourcing provider. </span>IT Staff Augmentation<span style="font-weight: 400;"> covers the requirement of unique skill sets required for specific projects or tasks but can&#8217;t be supported by an in-house IT team due to technical or logistical limitations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When staffing increases during peak periods, you may need temporary staff to augment the existing team. Outsourcing providers allow your organization to utilize this increased availability with little overhead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IT staffing companies can provide you with highly skilled &amp; experienced resources who know how to work with your systems and processes. Additionally, they can be contracted to bring on temporary staff when significant workload increases. This gives you an agile technology team that is uniquely qualified to tackle projects of all sizes and scopes and allows you to concentrate on running your company.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Business Functions Will You Outsource?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When outsourcing IT functions, it is important to start with the tasks that will have the least impact on your current staff&#8217;s workload. But what if you need help from outside companies to understand which IT services are best for your company? Consider asking for a free consultation from ValueCoders Consultants.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Determine which </span>IT Staff Augmentation <span style="font-weight: 400;">solutions will have minimal impact on your current staffing. Look at projects that don&#8217;t need to complete immediately or tasks that can be delayed. Your outsourcing provider should have no trouble helping you identify and prioritize which applications you should handle internally vs. which ones you should outsource. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinction is easier when your company only has a few IT personnel and there aren&#8217;t any pressing needs for new software or hardware. For example, outsourcing services make sense if your business doesn&#8217;t need video conferencing equipment until your needs change and expand.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is to make sure you always have an outside contractor to fall back on. This allows you to keep things under control in your business and take advantage of outsourcing when it makes sense for your company. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you need help installing a new database management system, you can contact an IT Staff Augmentation provider for assistance. Afterward, go back to handling database management internally by leveraging a remote cloud database server from Amazon Web Services (AWS).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to research your options carefully and find an IT staff augmentation provider that you feel confident in. Each outsourcing agreement is unique, but all of them should offer a contract where you have complete control over when your company is on call for support and what happens when that time comes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re looking for an </span>IT Staff Augmentation <span style="font-weight: 400;">provider to support your business now and in the future, ValueCoder may be a good fit.  We have assisted enterprises, startups, and SMEs with their digital transformation for over a decade.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Budget of IT Staff Augmentation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standard model of providing IT services is an in-house IT department. This is a larger expense, as the company must set aside more funds to cover staff salaries and equipment upkeep. However, this can lead to savings in other areas of business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a company must rely on outsourced contractors without in-house IT staff when disaster strikes. Contractors come at an increased cost and often lack the efficiency and knowledge that an experienced in-house IT staff member might offer.</span></p>
<p>The outsourcing model involves hiring a third-party IT firm to handle your company’s IT needs, including installing new equipment, providing repair and support services, and offering advice on improving your system. Outsourcing is less expensive than an in-house option. Many IT companies offer package deals that combine hardware maintenance and software support for a single fee.</p>
<p>However, deciding your budget or taking stock of all your current expenses is essential before selecting a service model. Start by counting how much you spend on IT currently. If you haven’t used outsourcing yet, determine how much you would be charged per hour for these services. Next, consider if increased or decreased support will benefit your business more to save time and money for future projects.</p>
<p>Based on your needs and project workload, this may make more sense for one company than another. Knowing where you stand financially can help ensure that choosing a new IT service model is an investment rather than a cost. With so many considerations to think about, narrowing down which one will work best for your organization can seem daunting. But anyone can find the right fit with careful planning and guidance from industry experts.</p>

<h2><strong>Things To Ensure Before IT Staff Augmentation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll need to have each contractor on your team sign a non-disclosure agreement so that you can remain confident in the work your</span> IT Staff Augmentation <span style="font-weight: 400;">company is doing. In addition, include language in your contracts stating that any code or design created by outside contractors will belong to you and not them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, you may include a clause prohibiting IT staff augmentation team members from working for competing companies. And you&#8217;ll want to make sure they sign an NDA when they work on your project so that you don&#8217;t end up with a competitor using your intellectual property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll also want to ensure that their contract states that all codes and designs created by outside contractors are yours, not theirs. And it&#8217;s always good practice to add a clause banning IT staff augmentation employees from working for competing firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have everything in writing, you can start hiring. Start your search by requesting references from your friends, business partners, and colleagues. You&#8217;ll likely be able to find local contractors through personal referrals as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, if someone asks where you found an IT staff augmentation team member who did great work for you, they can refer more business to that person, which means more work for them!</span></p>

<h2>How to Get Started With IT Augmentation?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&#8217;ve a sense of how</span> IT Staff Augmentation Services <span style="font-weight: 400;">work, it&#8217;s time to evaluate the options. An ideal place to start is with your industry contacts. Reach out to fellow business owners or colleagues in similar industries and see if they can recommend any reputable service providers in your area.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-33871" title="Accelerate Your Growth Steps to Success in IT Staff Augmentation" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Accelerate-Your-Growth_-Steps-to-Success-in-IT-Staff-Augmentation.png" alt="Accelerate Your Growth Steps to Success in IT Staff Augmentation" width="800" height="606" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Accelerate-Your-Growth_-Steps-to-Success-in-IT-Staff-Augmentation.png 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Accelerate-Your-Growth_-Steps-to-Success-in-IT-Staff-Augmentation-300x227.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Accelerate-Your-Growth_-Steps-to-Success-in-IT-Staff-Augmentation-768x582.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Accelerate-Your-Growth_-Steps-to-Success-in-IT-Staff-Augmentation-480x364.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also a good idea to search for opportunities through job boards and social media groups related to your industry. To ensure you&#8217;re working with a reputable company, run background checks on their employees (although it&#8217;s probably best not to go overboard here), talk with other clients, and ask about their experiences working with that provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you work with an offshore provider, you must write your agreement and establish expectations from both sides. Many service providers offer contract templates, so you can use that as a starting point when drafting your agreement. While they may look intimidating at first glance, they&#8217;re typically straightforward once you break them down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a standard contract doesn&#8217;t address your needs, ‌work with an attorney or service provider who can draft something more comprehensive that addresses any unique issues specific to your business and industry. You should also outline any special terms regarding pricing or payment within the contract itself to avoid misunderstandings down the line.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development has been around since the early <strong>1980s</strong>. Many businesses have turned to custom and off-the-shelf solutions. It is the best way to solve problems by using custom business logic without spending too much time and money on development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of software development spans centuries, not decades. From the first adding machine to calculate square roots hundreds of years ago, the technology has been advancing. Our civilization has been improving technology in ways previously deemed impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, those hardware and software upgrades brought some great advancements. It includes calculating calendars or even retail applications like letting customers buy things on credit. Moreover, Custom software development has always been a challenge for many companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A custom software project can be complex and time-consuming, which is why it&#8217;s important to have best practices in place to mitigate the risk of failure. So here, know which challenges and risks you can face while custom software development and how you can alleviate the risk with best practices. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Is Custom Software Development?</strong><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22512  aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/custom-software.jpg" alt="custom software development" width="854" height="477" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/custom-software.jpg 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/custom-software-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development is the process of building a custom solution for an organization&#8217;s needs. Customized solutions can come in many different shapes and sizes, such as mobile apps with specific features to fit your company branding or web applications that give customers easy access to their account info no matter where they are on any device.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many organizations choose this method because they are looking for something that&#8217;s not available in the market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development entails much more than just writing code to make an app or website work a certain way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also project management, QA testing, UI design, and branding involved in this process as well. With so many steps involved, it&#8217;s critical to have a solid roadmap in place with predetermined milestones.  </span></p>

<h3><strong>Process of developing custom software application</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>The process of developing a custom software application involves the following steps:</strong></em></p>
<h3><b>Define your needs:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before proceeding with any development or implementation plan, it&#8217;s important to first define your needs. This is the most critical part of any software development effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is because you want to make sure all requirements are clearly identified, documented, and analyzed for feasibility before writing a single line of code or designing screens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will help assure that everyone involved in this project is on the same page when it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comes time to start development work, and it also gives you a clear idea of your end goal. If </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you don&#8217;t take this step; it&#8217;s easy to lose sight of your project goals and get sidetracked by other nonessential features.   </span></p>
<h3><b>Specify the requirements:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once there is a clear understanding of what needs to be done, the next critical decision revolves around deciding how much work should actually go into each requirement before developing any solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you&#8217;ll need to do some careful analysis of requests and determine how they align with the business needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a customer comes up with an idea for a mobile application that can display all their products in one place, so they never have to worry about forgetting what&#8217;s on sale or running out of inventory, then this request is a great use case for some mobile-friendly web application.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just remember not to prioritize requests based on how interesting they are to you but rather on how much they&#8217;ll benefit the company&#8217;s business goals.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all possible features are listed out and sorted with proper priority, then it becomes easier for developers to determine which requests can be completed in less time without compromising their overall project objectives. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Also Read: <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/top-and-best-companies/top-5-custom-software-development-companies-offering-bespoke-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Top 25 Custom Software Development Companies Offering Bespoke Solutions</span></a></strong></em></p>
<h3><b>Determine the budget: </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting any development work, it&#8217;s important that everyone involved in this project is informed of the costs that are associated with it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes time, resources, and any additional expenses that might be needed to successfully complete a project. Without having an accurate estimate for how much work will go into each request, you run the risk of overspending on your budget or not being able to deliver features as quickly as you should. </span></p>
<h3><b>Define the scope:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once everyone has an idea about how long it&#8217;s going to take and what things are expected of them, then the next step is defining a clear scope for this project. This means detailing exactly how much work will be done on each request before moving on to other tasks or features that might come up later on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a solid roadmap is in place, it becomes easier for everyone involved to focus their efforts and make sure they&#8217;re spending time on the right tasks at any given moment.</span></p>
<h3><b>Establish milestones:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common practice among project managers when developing custom software applications is establishing short-term goals or checkpoints known as milestones. These are used to monitor progress, finalize requirements and ensure that everything is on track before continuing work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of milestones needed will vary depending on the size and complexity of a project, but they&#8217;re usually set at certain points in order to hit deliverables or key events such as initial development kickoff, launch date, or adding new features. This way, there&#8217;s always a clear idea of what has been achieved and how much work is left until the project is completed. </span></p>
<h3><b>Designing and Development:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the necessary groundwork completed, it&#8217;s time to start designing and developing your <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-development?utm_source=webblogwhitepaper-22511-customapplication&amp;utm_medium=S05" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">custom software application</a>. This is where you&#8217;ll need to make sure you have a solid team of developers who are well-versed in the latest technology trends as well as best practices for efficient development workflows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, in order to form a leading software, it&#8217;s important to use attractive UI/UX design, appropriate programming languages, and technologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHP, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python are the most preferred programming language for software development.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22514" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22514" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22514 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/languages.png" alt="Programming Languages" width="598" height="489" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/languages.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/languages-300x246.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22514" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                              Image Source:</strong> GoodFirms</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the globe, Linux is one of the most popular software development platforms.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22515" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22515" style="width: 616px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22515 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/popular-software-platform.png" alt="Software Platforms" width="616" height="580" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/popular-software-platform.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/popular-software-platform-300x282.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22515" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                            Image Source:</strong> 99firms</figcaption></figure>
<h3><b>Testing: </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don&#8217;t want to miss one tiny detail during this process. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to test each small piece of the software development chain before moving on and adding more features or functionality. </span></p>
<p>The best way to check whether there is any bug in your app or not. For this, you need to do beta testing, which can be done by asking clients to test the application.</p>
<h3><b>Deployment and Marketing:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deploying your custom software is not less important than any other phase of the development process. If you are deploying an app online, then first create a landing page for that particular app to tell people about it, and on that, insert Google Analytics code so that you can track visitors coming from different sources, i.e., search engines, referrals, etc.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, you need to promote your app and make it popular among the masses. You can do so by putting ads on different Google Adwords platforms or Facebook pages, and so on…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, by taking help from a recognized </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>custom software development company</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can manage all the custom software development processes in a simple and agile way.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Risk and Challenges Involved In Custom Software Development</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development is challenging work that comes with many risks. Like any project, there are always unforeseen circumstances that can happen along the way. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of some common risk factors involved in custom software development:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22516" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22516" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22516 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/challenges.png" alt="Risk and Challenges" width="655" height="570" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/challenges.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/challenges-300x261.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22516" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                           Image Source:</strong> GoodFirms</figcaption></figure>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>You&#8217;re Overly Ambitious</strong> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although you might think your idea is unique, there is a good chance that the features and requirements already exist in </span><b>custom software development </b><b>solutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Without looking into available options before diving headfirst into development, this can lead to wasted time and money when you realize it&#8217;s not what was needed after all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This typically happens with startups where the founder wants to create something that is much more than what they originally intended. </span></p>
<h3><strong>The Solution Is Not Solved</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&#8217;re working with custom software development, there&#8217;s always a chance that the solution isn&#8217;t solved in such a way that it&#8217;ll actually benefit the company moving forward. This could be because requirements were misunderstood or not well thought out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without making sure that the solution fits into your business model, it might not be worth all of the time and energy you put into development, to begin with.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Project Don&#8217;t Have Purpose</strong></h3>
<p>Without a clear purpose for the software you&#8217;re creating, it&#8217;s likely that your project will be abandoned. It may get limited in some way. Without having a solid goal to work towards, there is no direction. In fact, nobody can determine if they are reaching success because things like ROI cannot be calculated.</p>
<h3><strong>Poor Reach and Communication</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most projects need a team of people working together to make sure everything is completed as it should. There should be proper reach and communication from the team. Without this, things can slip through the cracks or not be done as they were intended. It ultimately leads to frustration on all ends. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Inaccurate Development Estimates</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to custom software development, most projects are done on an Agile or Waterfall model. These models require accurate estimates of the time and resources needed for each step in order to avoid going over-budgeted hours and having a team sitting around waiting to move forward with other parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Without planning properly and accurately estimating, you&#8217;re likely to see a lot of wasted time. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_22517" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22517" style="width: 812px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-22517 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reasons.png" alt="Estimates" width="812" height="387" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reasons.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/reasons-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-22517" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>                                                 Image Source:</strong> 99Firms</figcaption></figure>
<h3><strong>How To Alleviate The Risk Of Failure With Best Practices?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to avoid failure is by doing your research. You must know what you&#8217;re getting into before developing the software. This will help weed out any bad ideas or projects that are not feasible at the beginning of a custom development project.  </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Here&#8217;s how to reduce risks and challenges:</em></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Start with an MVP</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must start with an MVP (minimum viable product) if you want to reduce the risk of failure. Also, make sure you&#8217;re getting one that&#8217;s proven. This is a critical step in mitigating your risks early on while still allowing room for changes if needed.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Start Small</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to mitigate challenges during custom software development is by starting small and then expanding. This way, if something goes wrong with any step of the process, you can just go back to the previous stage and fix it instead of having to start all over again. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Prioritize</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another best practice is prioritizing your project in order to make sure everything gets done on time while minimizing risk. Make a list for every task, and then determine the order in which you want to do them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these best practices, you can reduce your risks of failure when custom software development is involved. Customizing a solution for your business needs may be complex and time-consuming, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be risky if you&#8217;re aware of all possible challenges ahead of time.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Communicate Frequently</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom software development requires a lot of communication between you and your developers. To reduce risks, make sure to communicate frequently about what&#8217;s going on with the project so there are no surprises later down the road or misunderstandings that can cause delays.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Technical Risk Mitigation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to custom software development, there are many variables that can cause challenges. </span>Technical risks include things like whether or not the code is maintainable and reusable for future projects. Moreover, this can be a case if all requirements have been met by everyone involved in the project.</p>
<p>There are also organizational risk factors such as a lack of communication between your team members. However, it may be if there are too many people working on the project at one time.</p>
<p>By following these risk mitigation best practices, you can avoid many of the major risks and challenges. This usually comes with developing a custom software solution for your business. The more prepared you are ahead of time, the better off you&#8217;ll be on project completion, and this is what a company wants?<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">Matching the changing pace of technologies and prospering the growth is the new face of business survival. Every passing day leads us to more advanced and trailblazing aspects of lifestyle through pioneering software development. From online shopping to taking online classes, from artificial intelligence to cryptocurrency, everything revolves around the digital ecosystem. Every effort of developers and programmers is to cater a soothing and hassle-free digital experience to every user.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/software-market-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Grand View Research</a>, the global software market size was estimated at USD 583.47 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.5% from 2023 to 2030.</p>
<p>Additionally, growing network security and privacy encourage company expansion. The COVID-19 epidemic had a favorable effect on the world market.</p>
<p>During COVID-19, businesses were encouraged to install software solutions and set up malware protection, recognition, and mitigation methods, which fueled the market&#8217;s expansion. This was due to growing worry about cyber threats.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3">How Vast is The Digital World Ecosystem?</h2>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Software Development &amp; Developers Market</h3>

<p class="graf graf--p">As always, the outline of software needs utmost attention to the end-user experience. However, digitalization compels industries to step forward to adopt cloud application services or SaaS (software as a service) to amplify user engagement. Although, the market still opens for other forms of software.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/software/worldwide#revenue" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">report, the software market revenue is projected to reach US $659.00bn in 2023, with enterprise software dominating the market with a projected market volume of US 271.80bn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The calculation of </span><a href="https://evansdata.com/press/viewRelease.php?pressID=278" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evans Data Corporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimates 26,4 million software developers in the world in 2019 and is expected to touch 28.7 million in 2024.

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Cybercrime Data analysis</h3>
<p>According to a post by <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8475-cost-of-cyberattack.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business News Daily</span></a>, cybercrime is predicted to cost $8 trillion in 2023 and will grow to $10.5 trillion by 2025</p>
<p>More user engagement makes data security more vulnerable and raises cybercrime concerns. <a href="https://www.fundera.com/resources/small-business-cyber-security-statistics" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60%</span></a>% of small businesses that are victims of a cyber attack go out of business within six months</p>
<p>On the surface, cybercrime is conducted in data theft, identity fraud, ransomware attacks, phishing campaigns, copyright infringement, etc. The consequences of these attacks can lead to data breaches.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/average-cost-healthcare-data-breach-11-million/688859/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a>, the average cost of a healthcare data breach rose to around $11 million in 2023, an increase of 8% from the previous year and a 53% increase from 2020.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-30912 size-full aligncenter" title="Screenshot from 2023 05 01 18 03 13" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13.png" alt="Screenshot from 2023 05 01 18 03 13" width="896" height="561" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13.png 896w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13-300x188.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-from-2023-05-01-18-03-13-768x481.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" /></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p>Every type of cybercrime leads us to data breaches, and hacking is one of the most common criminal activities on the internet.</p>
<p>Hackers exploit a weakness in online communication, digital networks, or computer systems and spread malware or gain unauthorized access to data to pursue criminal activities. All actions uplift the urgency of a robust defense system to stop cyber attacks.</p>
<p>While discussing data breaching, social media also is a massive center of attraction. However, many users are skeptical about the data being used.</p>
<p>Facebook received 64,148 requests for user information from US law enforcement agencies in the second half of 2022. Germany came in second with 17 thousand requests, followed by India with 63 thousand user data requests. A total of 239 thousand requests were made throughout the measurement period</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Web Application Vulnerabilities and Threats</h3>
<p>Misconfiguration in web application code allows hackers to get control over your website. That’s why the security of software development raises concerns to address web application vulnerabilities and threats.</p>
<p>The US government’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD) shares the case studies of cybercrimes of prominent organizations.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BMMJEm6-h9d4ggwJ" data-image-id="0*BMMJEm6-h9d4ggwJ" data-width="720" data-height="477" /></figure>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.tenable.com/press-releases/tenable-research-reveals-over-40-billion-records-were-exposed-in-2021" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tenable’s 2020 Threat Landscape Retrospective Report,</span></a> about 22 billion data were exposed in data breaches globally in 2020.</p>
<p>For more insights on ransom attacks, go through the pick points of Check Point Cyber Security Report 2021</p>
<p>Increment of 20% in email-based attacks from 2019 to 2020 as compared to web attack vectors.</p>
<p>In 2019 and 2020, Emotet was the most heavily distributed malware family. It is a botnet responsible for the distribution of Trickbot, Qbot, and more, in some cases resulting in a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>XMRig is the most attacked cryptominer, whereas Lucifer is a self-propagating, multi-platform malware targeting Linux, IoT devices, and Windows web servers.<br />
Hiddad or ‘Hidden Ad’ tops the chart of mobile malware global analysis. Through this malware, attackers can easily fetch the details from victims’ mobile by displaying ads. During COVID, the malware disguised itself as a coronavirus information app for Arab speakers.<br />
In 2020, a team of developers took 280 days to identify a cyber breach that led to the loss of nearly $4 million.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3">How To Approach Secure Software Development?</h2>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Cyberattacks and enhanced data security directs companies to think about secure software development. ValueCoders is India&#8217;s leading software <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>IT outsourcing company</strong></a> that continuously addresses defects to make secure software and reduce vulnerabilities. Divide software development lifecycle into different segments starting from requirements and move to other steps, designing, implementation, and testing.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The Software Engineering Institute developed the Team Software Process (TSP), allowing software developers and developer teams to create software under a definite process. This process wants companies to focus on:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Use common sense software engineering practices</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Tackle defects throughout the software product development lifecycle</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Use proper measurement to control the process</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Track the process and address defect prevention as well as removal</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Apply predictive measures for remaining defects</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Another significant example demonstrated by Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) practices. SDL practices support security assurance and compliance requirements and also reduce the severity of vulnerabilities in software development. As per Microsoft, software developers are suggested to follow various practices:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Providing training</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Define security requirements</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Define metrics and compliance reporting</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform threat modeling</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Establish Design requirements</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Define &amp; use cryptography</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Use third-party components to manage security<span style="font-weight: 400;"> risk</span></li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Use approved tools</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST)</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Perform Penetration Testing</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Establish a Standard Incident Response Process</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world where online retailers like Amazon are soaring to new heights, brick-and-mortar stores grapple with staying afloat. The key to survival lies in understanding customers like never before and meeting their needs with precision and finesse. This is where the transformative power of Big Data Analytics in the Retail Industry emerges as a savior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many retailers are embracing the cutting-edge tools of big data analytics to unveil invaluable insights about their customers and shopping habits. By doing so, they not only enhance their existing customer base but also draw in fresh patrons, boosting revenue and reshaping the retail landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent groundbreaking study conducted by </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/big%20data%20the%20next%20frontier%20for%20innovation/mgi_big_data_exec_summary.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKinsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that leveraging big data analytics could elevate retail operating margins by a staggering </span><b>60 percent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The potential lies in unlocking the goldmine of knowledge hidden within vast data sets, arming businesses with the know-how to make well-informed decisions, and elevating the shopping experience to uncharted heights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the retail industry witnesses an unprecedented shift, the allure of big data analytics has ensnared the attention of retail marketers. This rapidly growing trend fuels the relentless pursuit of data-driven strategies to revamp marketing efforts and steer businesses toward unparalleled growth. In this riveting blog, we explore the myriad advantages of Big Data Analytics in the Retail Industry and unveil how these businesses are boldly transforming their destinies through the power of data.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Before starting this, let’s seek the expectations of a retail business from big data analytics …</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this modern era, many companies have set the wrong goals for their big data analytics projects and failed to succeed in the long run. Have a look at some important goals below:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Improve Customer Experience</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data gather customer insights and then uses those insights to improve the customer experience. For example, retailers can use big data to understand what customers say about them online and use that information to improve their products or services.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Increase Sales</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data identifies trends and patterns that further increase sales. For example, retailers can use big data to understand what products are selling well and stock more of those items.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Improve Operational Efficiency</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data helps streamline operations and make them more efficient. For example, retailers can use big data to track inventory levels and change their stock management processes accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Reduce Costs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data identify areas where costs can be reduced. For example, retailers can use big data to understand where they are overspending and then adjust their budgets accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If retail businesses keep these goals in mind, they will be more likely to get the most out of their big data analytics projects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retailers are no longer trying to predict what you might be interested in buying. User behavior is being looked at to know what they want.

<h3><strong>Easy and Cheaper Storage Facility</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data is becoming easier to store, with storage space becoming cheaper daily. Now, you can invest in ample data storage on a large scale. Managing the data effectively and making it useful for analytics is the core focus for retailers at this point.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Provides Targeted Communication To Customers</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalized marketing is 20% more effective with ‌Big Data Services than traditional marketing practices. Data analysis helps companies track the buying process and capture past purchases of customers, which they use to target them with personalized communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot has changed in retail since manufacturers started using data to make their products better tailored towards specific demographics or needs; now, it’s not uncommon that marketers will crack open your credit card history before jumping into an online checkout flow!</span></p>
<h3><strong>Predicts Demand And Managing Inventory</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data analytics and Big Data development enable retail companies to understand the customers’ buying needs and focus on areas with high demand. The conclusion derived from the data has helped many retailers. They better understand what their target audience wants to strategically plan out the inventory levels — keeping themselves ahead in this fast-paced industry.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Optimizes The Price</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The retailer stage depicts the price of a product that gradually reduces after demand has subsided. However, it becomes more effective if you don’t reduce your prices during off-season periods or timeframes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using big data analytics, retailers can track customer spending patterns and preferences to gauge the prices most appeal to their customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can also use big data analytics to track inventory levels and sales rates to ensure they are not overstocking or understocking products.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you want to leverage the perks of all of this booming trend, you can embrace <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/big-data-application-development-services-company?utm_source=big_data_dev&amp;utm_medium=Big+Data+Analytics&amp;utm_campaign=Web_Blog&amp;utm_id=NKY_27064" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>Big Data development services</strong></a> in upcoming years. However, embracing it as soon as possible is admissible to gain competitive advantages.</p>
<h3><strong>Enhances Customer Experience</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data analytics helps retailers analyze how customers shop and use this data to produce a seamless customer experience. From choosing the product and updating account details like shipping address or payment method, all these tasks become easier with Data Analytics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many companies nowadays make it easy for their clients through convenience features. It features within each platform they provide access to, such as online order processing, where you can select from available options before buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, you can buy without entering personal information besides what’s already there. Plus, just check out quickly by providing basic info about yourself (like Order ID) if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process saves time and effort in re-entering new data with allocation at other places during busy work schedules.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Retain Customers</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retaining customers is not an easy task. It requires constant attention and focuses on what will keep them interested in your brand. It requires how you can engage with their needs or interests long-term. In this way, they become loyal patrons of yours instead of someone who spends time elsewhere doing business (sleepless nights).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data analysis helps identify those people who disengage by identifying patterns. An example of this includes frequent buying habits. These insights give retailers insight into introducing offers that may interest the customer to make purchases again while retaining current ones.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern times, <span style="color: #800000;">BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE IS CRITICAL!</span>. Without that, it is difficult to stay firm in the cut-throat competition. Organizations are substantial about <strong>BI intelligence tools</strong>. Without the right analytics and information, it is next to impossible to drive business dynamics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where key leaders are compelled to make choices against the backdrop of the right information.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The global BI software market size was valued at </span></i><b><i>USD 24.9 billion</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018 and cross a </span></i><b><i>CAGR </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of </span></i><b><i>10.1% </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from 2019 to 2025”.</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up an expository framework to break down information enables an undertaking to find valuable data, recommend conclusive directions and bolster decision-making. Microsoft has demonstrated its excellence in the field of innovation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of a Business Analytics tool, Microsoft Power BI, and reporting tool permits businesses to investigate information to transform operations. Roping into Power</span><b> BI consulting </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with years of expertise like ValueCoders, run your business in top gear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies very much into BI solutions are likely to consider Microsoft Power BI for several reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><b>So, do you want to catapult your business using BI Tools? </b></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;"> Here are the key advantages of the  platform:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><b> Seamless integration</b></span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-21167 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/power-bi-1.png" alt="" width="664" height="462" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/power-bi-1.png 664w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/power-bi-1-300x209.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><b>  Image Source:  Google</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how extensive your resources are, you will see a downwards curve if they lack integration. With the advent of Microsoft Power BI, businesses across the globe can integrate copiously in the existing business environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any enterprise using  Microsoft tools (Office 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams) can look for Microsoft Power BI since it is ideal for integrating with advanced cloud services, including cognitive services, Cortana, or Bot framework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power BI is exceptional for drilling down and suppressing data for better business relationships, hierarchies &amp; key metrics. Still, with native support for R scripts, users harness the advantage of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">business analytics, Machine Learning, predictive trends,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and smoothing.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><b>  Image Source:  Google</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Microsoft Power BI, you can customize information dashboards, making them suitable for the business environment. These dashboards can combine with on-premises and cloud data in a single view dashboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can monitor critical data throughout the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This particular platform allows users to customize the dashboard and make it conducive for the business environment. Such dashboards combine with on-premise and cloud-based data in a single dashboard. It is helpful for businesses to monitor critical data throughout the organization.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gle</span>Microsoft Power BI enables you to use natural language to extract answers straight from the data using the Q&amp;A feature. The Q &amp; A visual will enable users to ask questions in natural language and get answers in visuals.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the Q&amp;A feature, you explore insight by double-clicking on the blank part of the report canvas and using the “Ask a question box to ask questions related to data:” what were the sales of the quarter”?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">POWER BI automatically lists related comprehensive queries with a preview of a chart of table visualization that represents the data you’re looking for. Another key feature is </span><b>power BI services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support voice recognition Q &amp; A, making it possible to have information at your fingertips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounds like a gimmick, but Power BI’s natural language query engine is very intuitive and works exceptionally well &#8211; and with constant updates from Microsoft, it can only get better and more accurate as time grows. </span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><b> Minimal Technical support </b></span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Power BI has a great knack for integrating seamlessly for easy analysis without relying on specialized technical support. It supports a natural language interface with the use of intuitive graphic designer tools.</span></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><b> No memory/speed constraints</b></span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Growing business channels and traffic can often cause both memory/speed constraints. And this is the last thing business stakeholders want. The cloud-based system of Microsoft ensures that Power Bi is a cloud-based system with no memory and speed constraints when operational; it ensures saving data is quickly retrieved and analyzed and fosters up-to-data data analysis. Such a huge asset for enterprise needs. Isn’t it?</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><b> Embed BI Tools into your custom power apps</b></span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you use Power Apps? If so, you can harness the advantages of Power BI custom visuals to embed Power BI tiles inside your app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power BI native integration with PowerApps and contextual data. It updates real-time as you make changes to Power BI reports, allowing end-users to access live data insight using in-house-built custom applications within the same interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though you’re new, Power Apps implies an excellent enterprise tool to create business apps on web browsers &amp; OS&#8212; android, iOS &amp; Windows with a simplified interface that requires no coding experience, similar in usability to power BI.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With native integration between the services, it has become easier to share key insights with staff using in-house custom apps without needing access to Power BI itself. End-users can go extensive simply by clicking (or tapping, if on mobile) on the embedded Power BI tool to its dashboard, if public.</span></p>
<ol start="7">

<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><b> Drag-and-drop functionality</b></span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drag-and-drop functionality feature by Microsoft Power BI is quickly moving. It’s a part of the power on visual planner suite for power BI. In THE VISUAL PLANNER, when a user opens the power BI workbook, it is now enabled to write back. The admin allows users to edit the data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power BI&#8217;s drag-and-drop interface implies you no longer have to code or copy and paste anything to get started, and Power BI combines multiple files (i.e., Excel spreadsheets) and let you analyze the merged data in one report.</span></p>
<ol start="8">

<h3><span style="color: #000080;"><b> Constant Innovation</b></span></h3>
</li>

<p><b>“Innovation is the key to swim across all business channels.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” While staying ahead of the competition, Microsoft Power BI constantly updates functions and features to facilitate data collection and business operations.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Intelligence and Big Data are the two key players in the world of data processing. Big Data and BI are two different processes that occupy unique roles in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BI aims to collect, clean, and enrich structured or semi-structured data and then store it in different SQL databases. Data from various sources is stored in a data warehouse. Its goal is to support business decision-making with reports and dashboards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;">To clear up your doubts once and for all, look at the given infographic:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Infographic Showing Big Data VS Business Intelligence War:</span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/business-intelligence-consulting-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-19041 aligncenter" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Big-Data-VS-Business-Intelligence.png" alt="business intelligence consultant, business intelligence consultants, business intelligence consulting, business intelligence consulting companies" width="790" height="5458" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Big-Data-VS-Business-Intelligence.png 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Big-Data-VS-Business-Intelligence-148x1024.png 148w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Big-Data-VS-Business-Intelligence-768x5306.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></a></h2>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><b>Top 3 Open Source BI Tools:</b></span></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>BIRTH:</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIRT was first launched in 2004 and is an open-source analytics platform that helps produce visually appealing reports.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>JasperReport:</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Written entirely in Java, JasperReport is one of the most prominent and widely-used open-source reporting tools and can use data from any type of data source.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>KNIME:</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KNIME is an open-source </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/microsoft-power-bi-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>business intelligence testing</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool that integrates various data mining and machine learning components. The data can be enriched with the help of various business extensions that can be used here.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As its name suggests, Big Data refers to extremely large data sets that will be complex to manage with conventional databases. In Big Data, we often talk about the 3Vs theorized by Gartner, which are volume, speed, and variety.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong evolution of the masses of data, the speed at which your data travels, and the diversity of its sources will push us to use powerful tools to exploit all the data for better decision-making.</span></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><b>Top 3 Open Source Big Data Tools:</b></span></h2>

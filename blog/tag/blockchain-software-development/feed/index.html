<p class="graf graf--p">Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency developed by implementing the mechanism of Blockchain technology. This currency came into existence with the release of Bitcoin Whitepaper in 2009. It was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Right after its release, it gained huge popularity, and now it is the most expensive digital currency at present. The highest price has crossed the mark of $19K end. For some years, it has been hovering around $6K-$7K per bitcoin.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Bitcoin is created on a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm and approves transactions by validating. Even with the great popularity of crypto coins, these digital currencies aren’t liked by banks as they provide independence of finance to people.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ethereum:</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/a-comprehensive-guide-to-hire-ethereum-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a></strong> is blockchain technology that enables developers to create decentralized software solutions known as dApps. Moreover, the technical difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is huge.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Using Ethereum, developers can develop new apps in its blockchain and leverage smart contracts and dApps. Besides, Automation is also a critical aspect of the Ethereum network. It solves a number of problems assimilated into the blockchain.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Vitalik Buterin created Ethereum that solves a lot of problems from a different perspective. Moreover, Ethereum is also based on the Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm. However, it is planning to move to PoS in the future. Ethereum is termed the second generation of blockchain, which simply means that it leverages smart contracts to automate a number of tasks.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Besides, developers can build decentralized apps that will help them solve a number of problems or facilitate a number of services over the Ethereum platform.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">EOS:</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">EoS isn’t a popular term. However, it is a blockchain-based decentralized operating system designed to support, create, host decentralized automation applications and smart contracts. In addition, EOS nodes are bound in a constitution in blockchain to the rules and regulations delineated by the EOS community.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">EOS was unraveled by Dan Larimer. It is being administered by block.one organization. Its founder has also created BitShare and Steem. It is basically a platform that you can leverage to create and deploy industrial-scale applications.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It works similar to Ethereum and has the critical motive to remove transaction fees and provide scalability to save time. Its another application is to create dApps and scale them without struggling to network bottleneck.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*f1wxhlZxTs1p7nY2" width="710" height="560" data-image-id="0*f1wxhlZxTs1p7nY2" data-width="1400" data-height="1103" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.leewayhertz.com/what-is-eos-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-href="https://www.leewayhertz.com/what-is-eos-blockchain/" data-wpel-link="external">Image source</a></span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, EOS leverages a decentralized operating system that blockchain is scalable to ensure communication. Block.One is in charge of managing EOS development.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Hyperledger:</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Hyperledger is an open-source solution based on blockchain technology that provides the development of an enterprise-grade distributed ledger blockchain framework. The idea behind developing this open-source collaboration is to increase the accessibility of blockchain and work with it more.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Actually, Blockchain technology is gaining more traction among startups and tech giants, and they are striving to implement it into the ecosystem to ensure that data in organizations is secure and seamless. Thus, the hyperledger is being greatly used and being leveraged in a lot of cryptocurrency and enterprise solutions.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Popular projects under HyperLedger are Indy, Burrow, Fabric, Sawtooth. Moreover, digital transformation is another critical landscape of Hyper Ledger Blockchain Development.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">ICO:</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">An Initial Coin Offering is a digital concept of crowdfunding used to raise capital for new cryptocurrency ventures. In an Initial Coin Offering, some amount of the crowdfunded, including cryptocurrency, where crypto coins are preallocated to investors, named as “tokens.” In this system, tokens are exchanged for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">ICOs are typically used by startup companies looking to bypass the rigorous and regulated capital-raising process required by venture capitalists or banks. Initial Coin Offerings have been prone to scams, which are used for thieves to gain access to investors’ funds.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*6n-xRRvJmvuflDfV" width="836" height="274" data-image-id="0*6n-xRRvJmvuflDfV" data-width="1400" data-height="457" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are risks involved when dealing with Initial Coin Offering. This is an unregulated market of Initial Coin Offering where investors provide capital for startups with a high risk of failure. Initial Coin Offering can be used as a marketing tool for cryptocurrency projects to get their name out quickly and do so without the need for the traditional capital-raising process.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Security Token Offerings (STO):</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Just like ICOs, STOs have their own mechanism. It solves the problem by providing financial security that allows the participant to take part in the activities of companies such as voting rights. Moreover, actual assets or the company are backed by STO and require careful planning.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, Polymath is another actual problem that makes the implementation of STOs essential. ST-20 standards are major tokens for distribution, creation, and storage. To launch an STO, you would have to <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-blockchain-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Hire Blockchain Developers</strong></a> having incompetent expertise in blockchain security mechanisms and development.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Blockchain Digital Transformation:</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Blockchain technology is becoming a major trend among industries that enables businesses to ensure faster processes and more security in data. That’s the reason businesses are eager to deploy this technology within their enterprise ecosystem as a decentralized solution.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">That’s where the term digital transformation comes into the picture; it enables enterprises to transform the processes with blockchain decentralized ledger, smart cards, dApps, and more. Blockchain application development is the major process of this endeavor.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Smart Contracts:</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-smartcontract-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>Smart contracts</strong></a> are similar to legal contracts in a digital world that are written in code and signed by two parties. But! Here, parties can sign a contract to perform a task such as a transaction. Smart contracts can also be used to transfer assets and documents of properties and automate ownership.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*vXrn-01UYAuv-J31" width="784" height="587" data-image-id="0*vXrn-01UYAuv-J31" data-width="1160" data-height="868" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, copyrights and DAO (automate and organization) can also be performed using the smart contract. Smart contracts aren’t based on any centralized authority to verify the process. Hence, it is very advantageous. Besides, a contract can be held between two anonymous parties, where events are triggered, and codes can be executed.</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">DApp:</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">You might not have heard of dApps yet, but they already exist in the digital world. dApps means Decentralized applications are blockchain solutions that are created on the decentralized ledger and run on the blockchain network.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In dApps, developers can also implement smart contracts to make <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blockchain-development-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Blockchain Application Development</a></strong> more advanced. It provides dApp the potential to perform validations without human interference. Ethereum is the first blockchain-based dApp that allows developers to leverage smart contract consensus.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Another major aspect of dApp is that no centralized authority can control a dApp. The application can have its own cryptocurrency to perform activities.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HSOHqBk-8LhxpQE4" width="766" height="467" data-image-id="0*HSOHqBk-8LhxpQE4" data-width="1400" data-height="854" /></figure>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">A decentralized autonomous organization defines a close-knit system within an enterprise that leverages smart contracts and other blockchain features. The system automates the organization and eradicates the need for hierarchical management related to it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">To develop such autonomy, the codes are pre-written for a variety of processes and functionalities that DAO offers. The consensus protocol is a critical catalyst within the system. Ethereum and EOS offer support to DAO and enable users to define the rules to create a decentralized autonomous organization.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What Else Must You Know?</strong></span></p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Blockchain &amp; IoT</strong></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">The amalgamation of <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/blockchain-and-iot-the-stepping-towards-digitized-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Blockchain &amp; IoT</a> </strong>is a major point of interest among experts and technology enthusiasts. The proponents of this theory believe that blockchain would include more security to data in IoT networks and make the IoT ecosystem more secure and seamless.</p>

<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><b>2. Healthcare </b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Healthcare is a rapidly transforming sector presently, as a number of new technologies and software programs are being infused into the medical setting. But! How blockchain would improve this industry is incredibly astonishing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per a study by Johns Hopkins in the United States, </span>over 250,000 people die<span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of errors in medical aspects. To reduce this number, blockchain can help astoundingly. Blockchain data can be used tremendously to eradicate errors in medical data. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">When medical data of each patient is available on the blockchain, precisely the patient’s historical records can be used in the patient treatment and care. The physician will be able to access this data any time, anywhere, and errors in treatment can be overcome. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17966" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bl2.png" alt="Blockchain in Healthcare Industries" width="868" height="433" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bl2.png 868w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bl2-300x150.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bl2-768x383.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Moreover, errors in drug storage and quality checking of drugs can also be kept under precise surveillance through a blockchain distributed ledger system. Here take a glance at different way&#8217;s blockchain can be helped in healthcare: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Blockchain can be used to manage the cost of patient care &amp; treatment. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">It can aid in managing and preventing pandemics in the future. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">It will enhance research in medical treatment &amp; medicine. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">It will eradicate breaches in doctor-patient confidentiality.</span></span></li>

<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><b>3. SupplyChain </b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Curious to know how blockchain can affect the supply chain industry? Well! Your wait is over then. Actually, blockchain can turn out a boon for the supply chain industry as it has the potential to keep track of each good in the supply chain process.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">It can trace all the steps of the supply chain from the placing of order to final delivery. From the company that ordered the goods and vendors, trucks that carried the goods, and stops of orders, everything can be traced seamlessly to the distributed ledger. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><b>#7. Crowdfunding </b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Crowdfunding is a huge world to dive into but not as complicated. It’s a popular way to raise money for startup projects and charities, surprising the era of the modern Internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crowdfunding sector is perfect for blockchain tampering. In particular, the blockchain industry responds to crowdfunding, the </span>Initial Coin Offer (ICO) is already very popular among startups today. In short, ICOs, which are in line with public offerings, involves issuing tokens that act as shares of the company without an exchange of equity. Investors buy crypto-assets (such as tokens) instead of shares, using opposing currencies such as cryptocurrencies or US dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In fact, the development of the crypto world will not last forever. One of the most recent inventions, an Initial Exchange Offer (IEO)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, could soon disrupt how to raise startup funds through token sales. In this new system, signals are sent to a suitable exchange, which acts as a counterparty and makes them available to individual investors.</span></span></p>

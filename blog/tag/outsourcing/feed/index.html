										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, most tech startups, in fact, enterprises have drifted away from developing new software products in-house. But is it right to stop growth in the face of a disaster such as this?</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the novel coronavirus is as big as a problem as it gets. But the world will eventually come out of it. At that time, would you want your startup to take its time to freshen up and understand the needs of the market? Or would you want to start preparing a great software product so you&#8217;re ready when the market needs it most?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure your choice would be the latter, but most businesses have their hands tied. They&#8217;re unable to operate due to lockdowns, disruption in supply chains, unavailability of staff, and out of myriad problems created by COVID-19. Yet, there are few businesses that are fortunately <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/covid-19-are-we-ready-to-face-this-global-adversity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">working as smooth as ever</a>, especially in the software outsourcing sector.</p>
<p>So if a business (maybe yours) is unable to work on an in-house software project due to COVID-19, is it a wise choice to outsource it to an <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">offshore software development company</a>? Why outsourcing is important? What are the benefits of outsourcing a software development project?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, if you&#8217;re a tech startup in desperate need to capitalize on an opportunity and establish a market presence, then:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1- This isn&#8217;t the best time to run your business. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2- Once we&#8217;re done with COVID-19, the state of the market at the time will present unprecedented opportunities that startups could capitalize on. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the same time, your startup could be competing with 100s of established enterprises looking to capitalize on the same opportunities.</span></p>
<p>Is there something you could to have an edge over potential competitors in such a scenario?<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong> Product Development Outsourcing</strong></a> could be the masterstroke for a competitive advantage in the long-run. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-3822 size-full aligncenter" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg" alt="outsourcing product development" width="800" height="628" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/outsourcing-product-development-300x236.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you may know, there are multiple options available in the market to build functional software products. However, when it comes to startups, there&#8217;s a conventional line of thought which says that the benefits of outsourcing are for enterprises only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you can certainly outsource product development as a startup and this is important to your business as well, especially in this pandemic situation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Benefits of Outsourcing</strong><br />
</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple benefits of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/it-outsourcing-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing IT and software development services</a>. let&#8217;s start with cost.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cost-cutting</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing a budget is a big challenge for startups. However, outsourcing helps a lot to do it right. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In fact, according to a research, 87% of US companies outsource product development to save cost.  </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing provides a global talent pool at a low cost. You hire a backend developer (in-house) at  98000 USD/year and it comes down to 22000 USD/year when you outsource.<br />
</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The risk is lesser</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of new products whose market is yet to be tested, outsourcing plays an important role in mitigating the risks of trying out something new. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Since the outsourced teams work on flexible models the risks are definitely lower.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>It&#8217;s Faster</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing the development helps in faster development with the Agile model and helps in tremendously reducing the time to market. </span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Technical Expertise</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may be new to the market. That&#8217;s not an issue until you have technical expertise with you. If you already have that, then it&#8217;s good, however, if you don&#8217;t- then it is better to outsource.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Free up time and more focus</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For startups, investing time into high priority things is very important. One of the greatest benefits of outsourcing is that you free up your time for other important things. This helps a lot.  This image will show you some other reasons why is outsourcing important:<br />

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>key steps for your startup to effectively outsource product development</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b><b>Choose the Right Vendor</b></b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right vendor for outsourcing application development is a must. An <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=blog_al&amp;utm_medium=startup_prodev_3816&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing company with expertise</a></strong> in the required development skills will surely be helpful. Picking up freelancers is definitely not advisable, as they cannot be relied upon, for taking up product ownership. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the important points to consider </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while selecting a vendor for outsourcing development is the flexibility of hiring models. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps the startup choose a hiring plan that will optimize the costs of outsourcing in accordance with the development requirements. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important to evaluate the portfolio of the hiring vendor to understand the level of specialization in different business verticals.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Defining The Scope Of The Project</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second most important step in outsourcing your product development is to define the scope of the project. First, you need to convert the business idea into a business plan and then put down what all you need from a successful product. Defining the technology with which you wish to develop your product is another crucial decision. This also helps in defining the skill levels of the teams you wish to hire. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the scope of the project is defined and the vendor for product development has been chosen, the service level agreement with the vendor can be created. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps in ensuring that the outsourced teams are working according to the plan of action. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outsourced teams must be clearly communicated about the expectations and the milestones. This helps in developing mutually beneficial relationships with the outsourcing partner.</span></p>

<h3><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Communication</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping in touch with the outsourcing partner on a regular basis and reviewing project work in progress on a constant basis is important. This is helpful in improving project productivity levels. Motivating remote teams with incentives and appreciation is helpful in getting better business results.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overall, a continuous communication helps you to finish tasks smoothly.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshoring and outsourcing are similar business strategies that involve one party hiring another to take care of specific business processes that the company cannot do, like manufacturing and design. The biggest difference between offshoring and outsourcing is that offshoring refers to an international process, while outsourcing occurs within the same country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if company A hires company B to create a website in the United States, company A has outsourced this work to company B, while if company C is based in India, hires company D in Singapore to do the same work, then company C has offshored this work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This post will discuss the pros &amp; cons of both outsourcing vs. offshoring your business, so you can decide which is best for your business.</span></p>
<h2>What is Offshoring?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshoring, also known as offshoring trade or outsourcing, transfers portions of a business process to another country with lower costs. It occurs when a company moves its operations to another country. Offshoring can be partial or complete. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partial offshoring includes such practices as shipping goods from one country to another for final production and then sending the finished goods back to their home market. Complete offshoring refers to shifting all production tasks overseas, including research and development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was first used in the 1980s by IBM, which sent software jobs to India&#8217;s HCL Corporation. Offshoring has become more popular today as technological advances have made it easier for companies to do so.</span></p>

<h2>What is Outsourcing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing is shifting work to a third party, like an</span> <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/offshore-software-development-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Offshore IT Company in India</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who will carry out the work. Outsourcing allows businesses to focus on their core business and eliminates redundancies. For example, if a company outsources its payroll function to an offshore company in India, it could pay for the service once instead of paying salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses outsource to save money and eliminate redundancies. There are many advantages to outsourcing, but there are also disadvantages as well. Many companies need more time or resources, so they need to allocate funds to hire additional staff or personnel outside the company, which can be expensive. We can talk about that in more detail.</span></p>

<h2>Understanding the Differences between Offshoring and Outsourcing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268938/global-it-spending-by-segment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statista </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the global information technology (IT) spending on devices, including PCs, tablets, mobile phones, printers, as well as data center systems, enterprise software, and communications services came to 4.7 trillion U.S. dollars in 2023 and is expected to increase to around 5.1 trillion dollars in 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When comparing</span> Offshoring Vs. Outsourcing<span style="font-weight: 400;">, we can see that the best option will depend on the needs of your business and how you want to approach this process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, offshoring companies are more likely to offer a higher level of expertise than outsourcing companies, while the latter may provide faster and less expensive services. Let&#8217;s look at the detailed comparison:</span></p>

<h2>Importance of Offshore Software Development</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reasons offshoring is essential are numerous; some of them are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It can save labor costs by hiring cheaper workers abroad.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It will take less time to complete a project since your overseas developers have 24/7 access to the project they&#8217;re working on. They&#8217;re usually able to work on them during their time zone rather than waiting for you to be available.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You&#8217;ll have access to highly qualified workers with skill sets that you may need for a particular project but don&#8217;t have locally.</span></li>
<li> Between Offshore vs. Outsourcing, offshoring is always better because it gives you access to resources in other countries with no negative impacts of outsourcing. One major difference between outsourcing and offshoring is where your staff works.</li>

<h2><strong>Reasons Why Companies Outsource</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are several reasons companies prefer outsourcing, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce costs. It is more affordable for a company to outsource its software development needs than to do it in-house. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company might need more software development expertise for the project&#8217;s specific requirements. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing is convenient for companies with no dedicated software development department, so they outsource their projects to offshoring vendors. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies might use outsourcing as market research. You can do this if you are looking for different opinions from an outside source on your product or website before launching it.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Reasons Why Companies Offshore</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons companies go for </span>offshore software development services:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the low cost of hiring developers in the country, companies opt for offshore. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-world countries could lack qualified professionals in a company&#8217;s very own country. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore teams often have much more experience in specific technologies than those from average developed countries like US or Canada, so they may be able to finish projects much faster than teams from developed countries with less experienced developers on board.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshoring can provide peace of mind due to geographical distance. If anything goes wrong, it won&#8217;t affect the company as badly as if there was no separation between them and their outsourced team.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, top offshore software development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies offer detailed pricing policies. You don&#8217;t have to worry about paying extra fees after your initial contract expires or being forced into unnecessary upgrades at every turn.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Business Processing Outsourcing (BPO)</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BPO or Business Processing Outsourcing is when a company outsources the operation of its business processes to a third party. Unlike offshoring, BPO works with the customer&#8217;s internal staff rather than transferring employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring a </span>Top Offshore Software Development Services Company<span style="font-weight: 400;"> can offer many benefits, such as lower costs and faster implementation times. Whether you are considering offshoring or BPO, it is important to research beforehand to find out which option best fits your needs.</span></p>

<h2>Choosing the Best Option</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that is not an easy question to answer because both services  have advantages and disadvantages. For example, if you are looking for a software development company in India, you can go with the offshore IT company in India. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if your company needs a solution such as software development outsourcing services from <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/?utm_source=ValueCoders&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=Web+Blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Top Offshore Software Development Services Company</a>, then it might be better to outsource the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence it depends on the business requirements. In short, they both have their own set of benefits and shortcomings. Which one should we choose? The answer is: It all depends on what is more important to you!</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Are Your Requirements For An Outsourcing Company?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore vs. outsourcing requires much research when deciding which option to go with. Each outsourcing company has specific requirements for its prospective clients. Let&#8217;s look into the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need cost-effective solutions, focus on Indian companies, as they are known to provide reasonable rates.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to hire somebody who can understand your business culture, ensure that the provider is from your home country.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always get references from other provider customers before making any commitments.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to determine how much time it will take to complete a task before deciding which provider to work with.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also crucial to determine if any guarantees are in place in case anything goes wrong with the project.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Questions may help you determine whether an outsourced company would suit your needs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does it mean to outsource?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does it mean when something gets offshored?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do I need an offshore development team?</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshoring is when a company sends work to another company in a different country. It&#8217;s typically used by companies who want to stay competitive in the global marketplace but do not want to relocate their operations. Outsourcing‌ is when a company contracts with another organization or individual to provide a service or product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When comparing O</span>ffshore vs Outsourcing<span style="font-weight: 400;">, choosing one of these depends on what you&#8217;re looking for. Outsourcing may be your better choice if your business needs a single job. But offshoring might be more advantageous if you look for a long-term relationship that will grow as your business grows.</span></p>

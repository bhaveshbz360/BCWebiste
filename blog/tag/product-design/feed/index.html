										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been estimated that around </span><b>90% of users </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">have stopped using a mobile app because of poor performance. This study has proved that a high-quality user experience (UX) design is no longer a competitive edge alone. Instead, UX is a critical element in ensuring long-term market success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a successful mobile app UI/UX Design, you need to first understand how to resolve the pain points of a user, learn about their latent behaviors, and needs are the only way to ensure exceptional product performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between humans and technology is continuously evolving; however, businesses have to make sure that they emphasize mobile app UI/UX design in their </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>mobile app development</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that point, companies need to keep abreast of all the latest and emerging UX trends to meet the changing needs of mobile users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the principles of UX design may not change, the trends and techniques certainly do. In this blog, I will try and identify the key UX design trends that will make it big in the year 2022.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Trends in UX Design for 2023</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build a robust application, always use trending things that are liked by users, which helps you to gather mode customers. The application which has a good user interface is usually liked by all. You can also </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>hire mobile app developers</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build a robust mobile app UI/UX design. Let&#8217;s discuss a few mobile app UX design trends.</span></p>
<h3><b>1) Voice Experiences</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14045" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f.png" alt="Mobile app Ideas" width="683" height="513" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f.png 1600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f-300x225.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f-768x576.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fe33168e77221c381fba980db50f8a7f-1536x1152.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands are incorporating voice search technology more in mobile apps, and it&#8217;s the beginning to incorporate vocal user interfaces (VUI). At least, the companies are trying to integrate VUI in some capacity to meet the changing expectations of smartphone users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many roadblocks in the pavement of Voice Search Experiences, and Accessibility issues are the primary concerns as current voice technologies have shown difficulties in accurately identifying instruction where heavy accents or background noise is present.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, a VUI allows actions to be executed based on spoken commands. Changing interfaces requires mobile app designers to abandon old techniques and mindsets for what it means to design a mobile app experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VUIs won&#8217;t entirely take over mobile experiences, though the technology has been showing significant potential for enabling further advancements in consumer AI technologies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">eMarketer,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  there are nearly 150 million smartphone users who will be using Voice Assistants in 2022. </span></i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emergence of voice technology has given rise to almost 70% of voice searches by 2022.</span></i></span></p>

The trends mentioned in the write-up will offer you leading ideas to develop a top-notch mobile app UI/UX design.</span></p>
<h3><b>2) Designing for Healthier Relationships with Technology</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14044" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1.png" alt="Mobile app - Customer Engagement" width="760" height="308" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1.png 2550w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1-300x122.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1-1024x415.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1-768x311.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1-1536x623.png 1536w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Early-Learning-Tech-Graphic1-2048x830.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is awakening to the need for a mindful relationship with technology. Mobile app users want solutions for their pain areas, but they still want their time off from the app. Instead of fighting for attention, mobile app designers should find relevance and comfort while maintaining a meaningful place in the user&#8217;s daily life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trend is centered around mobile UI/UX designers that need to keep up with the pace of technology to develop healthier habits and design experiences that empower and enable users to achieve their personal goals while respecting their life outside of the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A relevant example that validates the trend above is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram&#8217;s All Caught Up Feature</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The purpose of this feature is to notify users that they have viewed all the recent posts. When users are aware that they&#8217;ve reached the end of their feed, they no longer need to keep scrolling, which saves time and limits distraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS, 2009);</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of Australian users used advanced technologies and social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube) in apps to share more information related to education, and this increased the figure by 84% in 2013. It also impacted customer and business relationships</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, along with the time the requirements and demand of the users are increasing to fulfill the same business, they have to change their ways and plan something unique to attract the users; this thing can easily be implemented by developing and using an impactful mobile application.

<h3><b>3) Deeper Personalization with Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine Learning (ML)</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12802" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1.jpg" alt="Mobile user experience" width="702" height="341" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1.jpg 1055w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1-768x374.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1-1024x499.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Featured-1-600x292.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year 2022, has marked a substantial growth towards more profound and more sophisticated personalization in mobile UX. As AI and ML continue to take giant leap strides in the ability to understand user behavior and interaction, mobile-based products or apps are becoming more personalized with each passing year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to UX design, the key is to design something flexible as per user preferences and choices. Functionality and in-app content should match user data, such as location, purchase behavior, online communities, events, and personal calendar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of artificial intelligence in mobile apps, and software are increasing day by day, that&#8217;s why </span></i><a style="color: #008000;" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/941835/artificial-intelligence-market-size-revenue-comparisons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worldwide revenue from the AI market</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is projected to reach up to 97.9 billion U.S. dollars by 2023.</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands such as Spotify have already been working on the user&#8217;s playlist&#8217;s customization by curating custom playlists with suggestions based on previous listening behaviors. </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile app developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to tap into AI and ML personalization opportunities as much as possible to supply variable content where appropriate.</span></p>
<h3><b>4) Designing for Consistency between IoT and Wearable Devices with the Cloud</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14048" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Multiexperience-The-Future-of-Mobile-App-Development.jpg" alt="Mobile app related wearable devices" width="694" height="364" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Multiexperience-The-Future-of-Mobile-App-Development.jpg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Multiexperience-The-Future-of-Mobile-App-Development-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Multiexperience-The-Future-of-Mobile-App-Development-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Multiexperience-The-Future-of-Mobile-App-Development-768x403.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the number of IoT and smart devices continue to rise drastically. Users expect seamless integration and responsive design that covers all devices and platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile UX designers need to look at creating integrating experiences between physical design and the functionality of each design as well as interaction design within the whole IoT system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 5G technology, slowly starting to roll out, the more stable network will allow more apps to rely on the cloud.  For mobile app developers, the cloud will be a valuable tool for designing consistency among IoT devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud-based connected devices allow designers to keep all platforms and software up-to-date. As a result, it will provide users with seamless transitions between system elements with minimum effort, adaptation, and wasted time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of usage of wearable devices worldwide has more than doubled in three years, rising from 325 million in 2016 to 722 million in 2019. The number of devices is projected to reach more than </span></i><a style="color: #008000;" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/487291/global-connected-wearable-devices/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20connected%20wearable,than%20one%20billion%20by%202022." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 billion by 2022 end</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example of this is Google&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Google Nest. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product helps a user control their home&#8217;s temperature. All nest products (mobile app, smartwatch app, and thermostat) stick to a similar design pattern, distribute functionality according to the device&#8217;s specifics, and build a user interface relevant to the system&#8217;s elements. Similarly, the way a user interacts with the Nest is the same across all platforms.</span></p>

<h3><strong>5) Coding becomes a part of the Design Process</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14043" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Overview-1-1011x550-1.png" alt="Mobile app development" width="677" height="368" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Overview-1-1011x550-1.png 1011w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Overview-1-1011x550-1-300x163.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Overview-1-1011x550-1-768x418.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a question that always goes around on whether a designer should learn how to code and make it a part of the design process, as a designer can come up with feasible technical suggestions, but there&#8217;s a point in this context that a designer is a designer at the end of the day and mobile app development companies should ensure that the code should not take away the designer&#8217;s designing capabilities, which is the primary role of a designer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several prototyping tools, bridging the gap between designers and mobile app developers working on the design systems at a scale, helping programmers build upon designs instead of replicating them in production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward in 2022, you will see more design tools coming up, a popular example of such a tool is</span><a href="https://www.uxpin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> UXPin</span></a><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">which lets you design, prototype, and collaborate all in one place.</span></p>
<h3>6) Designing for Speed</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14042 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mobile-Speed-App-Developer-Magazine_zwp3wqz6.jpg" alt="Mobile Apps Speed" width="631" height="522" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mobile-Speed-App-Developer-Magazine_zwp3wqz6.jpg 631w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mobile-Speed-App-Developer-Magazine_zwp3wqz6-300x248.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Source: Google</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emergence of 5G has already created a stir in the world of technology. This new infrastructure will strengthen mobile connectivity, thereby improving the smartphone experience. Ten times faster than the existing wireless technology, as 5G gradually replaces 4G networks, users will notice a significant improvement in data transfer speed and latency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that any mobile services, be it an application or a website, optimize it for mobile to support the speed and full capabilities of 5G networks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #008000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">86% of marketers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consider improvements in speed for mobile apps, and sites are helping in increasing customer satisfaction scores.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is news circulating about the release of iPhones in 2022, that comes with 5G capabilities. In this environment, slow applications will be seen as having a bad UX. Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that the app provides a fast, efficient, and smooth experience.</span></p>

<h2><strong>The State of UI/UX Design In Mobile App Development</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state of UX Design in mobile app development has not taken the traditional approach; rather then it has been adapting to changes not only in user interactions, preferences, and behaviors but in physical changes to the very devices you use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology changes, the design must also adapt to provide users with a varied range of options so that they can find the ones that best fit their needs. User experience encompasses all aspects of the end user&#8217;s interaction with a company, its services, and its products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping an eye ahead on the latest design trends will help UX designers and mobile app developers to innovate, collaborate all in one place and at pace.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Summing Up</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blog is all about UI/UX Design and </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/mobility/top-10-mobile-app-development-trends-and-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">trends in Mobile</a> App Development, and now it&#8217;s clear that if a mobile app UI/UX design is bad, then it will for sure not attract the users, and ultimately mobile apps will be less consumed by the users. So while building, the mobile application must focus on UI/UX design, advanced technologies, features, and functionalities.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the mobile app development process, all the development factors starting from <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/40-best-app-startup-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>app idea</strong></a> research to releasing the app on the app store or Google play store, play a vital role. If the developer skips any of the stages like testing and security configuration, it will affect the mobile app UI/UX design, functionalities, and user interface. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To manage such things before starting the development process, make the proper module as <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>ValueCoders</strong></a> (one of the </span>best <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/software-outsourcing-services-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">outsourcing software development to India</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) developers made.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern-day tech is changing humankind&#8217;s lifestyle incessantly, and spending time on different software solutions has become an everyday routine of people in the 21st century. It is impossible to imagine any everyday activity, especially at the workplace, without any computer-related process.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we look in-depth, software product development is the major process in the arena that is defined as a precise procedure, inclusive of different strict steps known as the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/outsourcing-and-off-shoring/software-product-development-life-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software Development Life Cycle</a>. If you need a sophisticated application system (either web or mobile app), you look forward to this process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely, you would have several questions and confusions pertaining to SDLC and its processes. Thus, we will take a comprehensive look at the software product development process in this article. </span></p>
<h2><b>Decoding Software Product Development Process</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/stages-in-software-product-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Software product development process</a> is a term defined as collective steps needed to develop a software product from its initial stage to market presence. Typically, it consists of a number of phases in the complex process of delivering a new product and transforming an old product notion into a marketable solution. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-27579 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z.png" alt="image 2022 11 17T12 14 04 506Z" width="1627" height="665" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z.png 1627w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z-300x123.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z-1024x419.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z-768x314.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image_2022_11_17T12_14_04_506Z-1536x628.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1627px) 100vw, 1627px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is all about the rules and practices that assist in connecting tech, non-tech teams, and project stakeholders in bringing ideas into digital products or software solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process starts from ideation and concludes with product features, pricing strategy, and distribution strategy. In the beginning, the processes hover around the area and market. Although the product development process aims to maximize the product value and mitigate the risk, failure occurred due to poor quality, noncompetitive pricing, retard and premature entry, weak promotion, and bad brand awareness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, now you would have understood what the software product development process is. Let&#8217;s take an in-depth glance into the processes it consists of.</span></p>

<h2><b>Step By Step Software Product Development Processes </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software development process is an amalgamation of different processes, and each has its own significance that empowers the complete process with different attributes and insights. Owing to that, many businesses consider </span>product development consulting<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do everything right in step by step order. So, let&#8217;s take a glance at the step-by-step processes included in software <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/startup-product-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">product development for startups</a>.</span></p>
<h3><b>#1. Brainstorming The Ideas &amp; Planning </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brainstorming is the initial stage of this cycle, where we define the concept for the product. First, it begins with a great idea that you need to carefully think over in order to implement. Besides, the processes can also be termed as idea generation, as we think of every step or stage of the product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact is that a business generates a number of ideas, and a handful is good. The process may include : </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussing the project value and idea with the development team</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather information from the market or go through the market statistical occurrence </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describing the concept and idea on a document and sought <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/case-studies/request-approval-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">approval of stakeholders</a> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you brainstorm over all the ideas and decide the one to implement, It&#8217;s time for planning. Meticulous planning is one core phase of software development. It determines the scope of the project and defines means that can meet strategic business objectives. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20650" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC.png" alt="" width="902" height="528" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC.png 902w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC-300x176.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/SDLC-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://www.scnsoft.com/blog/software-project-planning" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, planning also includes considering resource availability &amp; allocation, cost determination and budgeting, timeframe, and determining solutions. Once the perfect plan is determined, you are ready to move forward. Although having a detailed plan is another perk that can turn out very fruitful. </span></p>
<h3><b>#2. Product Research &amp; Requirement Analysis </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is critical to have the right product concept in your mind. If you miss out on this, you can fail to validate your idea first and then end up losing precious time in re-considering. Product research and validation enable you to ensure that you are going to develop a product that users will like to pay for, and you won&#8217;t be wasting time or money. Here are the ways you can conduct product research to validate your idea. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conduct an online survey to get feedback </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Begin a crowdfunding campaign </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking for feedback on forums like Quora or Reddit </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researching in the demand </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this phase, you would be able to define the project in detail and analyze the feasibility. During this process, you need to gather a deeper understanding of the project goal and collect all requirements.  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20651" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfgdf.png" alt="" width="566" height="294" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfgdf.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fdfgdf-300x156.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">product development engineer</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carry out the feasibility analysis that allows them to consider all technical and economic aspects and impacts on the development process, time, resources, tasks, team members, and calculating ROI is majorly defined in the feasibility analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although requirement analysis assists in identifying risks in the beginning stage, it helps identify the risk mitigation strategies that can be implemented from the beginning. </span></p>
<h3><b>#3. Prototyping &amp; Design </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prototyping is the process of creating the preliminary product to test the design of the product and validate the idea. It enables product developers to cater a solution to stakeholders, which can be used for marketing purposes. Once you develop a prototype, your product starts taking a form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After prototyping comes the design of the product, where the actual conceptualization of the solution happens. In design, the detailed software architecture gets developed to meet specific project requirements. The custom-tailored software design helps in defining workflow and standards. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20652" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vxcvzc.png" alt="(Design Principles In Software Development" width="766" height="517" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vxcvzc.png 766w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vxcvzc-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Design Principles In Software Development)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/principles-of-software-design/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, it encompasses overall solution design along with the database. In this phase, the complete product is developed as a mockup or prototype for the next stage of </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/custom-software-development-services-company?utm_source=website-20648-productdev-process&amp;utm_medium=d7&amp;utm_campaign=website-20648-productdev-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><b>custom software development</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From features of the solution to defining hardware and software components are inclusive. </span></p>
<h3><b>#4. Development &amp; Coding </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the designing has been done, now comes development, which majorly includes code writing and transforming design documents into an actual software project. It is the lengthiest cycle of a software development project, as being the backbone of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole process relies on this and a vital thing to pay attention to. The work of the software engineering team is that its code meets the software requirement specification and matches the stakeholder&#8217;s requirement. However, the previous stage of software is fulfilled carefully then a ready-to-use software is bound to match the needs. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-21279" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfddfdf-1.png" alt="" width="566" height="294" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this phase, the software release cycle takes place in three stages, including alpha, beta, release to actual product. </span></p>
<h3><b>#5. Integration &amp; Testing </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when the software is developed, then comes the next phase involving system testing and integration. The process can vary due to the testing processes. But Typically, QA engineers leverage a wide range of frameworks along with integration executing unit tests, automation compilation, and manual testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QA team performs a number of tests, including functional testing, interoperability, system integration, and acceptance testing, etc., in order to ensure that code is clean and the business goals of the solution are met. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, validation and verification are critical aspects of </span>software product development services<b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">ensuring the application/solution is completed successfully. When the software turns into a bug-free solution, deployment starts.</span></p>

<h3><b>#6. Implementation and Deployment </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the process where actual thing-installation happens of the solution. It is a retrospective process after the implementation plan. In this phase, the newly developed and tested application goes forwards to the production stage with the inclusion of data and component transfer. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20654" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfdff.png" alt=" Implementation and Deployment" width="626" height="225" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfdff.png 551w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dfdfdff-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/software-implementation" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source </span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the specific changes will be deployed during the release. Moreover, it can be a straightforward release depending on the complexity of the project. After this, system analysts and end-users can actually try the ready-made application. </span></p>
<h3><b>#7. Operations &amp; Maintenance </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now comes the final stage, where the software development life cycle includes maintenance and regular updates. The phase is regarded as of utmost importance as you collect the real-world feedback and tweak the solution in order to polish it, enhance, and upgrade the fine-tuned solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this phase, the performance gets looked at, and an upgrade takes place to modify the solution according to need and performance aspects. The actual need of the end-user and new capabilities are met by additional user requirements. </span></p>
<h2><b>Wrapping Up </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, the software development processes vary from company to company depending on the aim, such as delivering the best quality product that satisfies the need of product demand. Moreover, customer demand is the major aspect targeted during the processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The processes of </span>product development engineering<span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be shaped and altered depending on the need of each particular project, such as app development, a software provider to identify precise action, and the particular goals achieved. At the same time, the process declaration is a foundation measure to arrange the model for defining frameworks and equip team members in both technical and non-technical works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the quality of code and solution in general, the expectation needs to meet the project manager&#8217;s decision-making progress and more. In the end, the final product is all that matters. Relevant software development processes can help in meeting the customer&#8217;s expectations and by well-tailored and great software solutions that meet business needs and offer exceptional customer satisfaction. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has ideas. But do we realize how difficult thriving, workable products or services? Indeed, a hard nut to crack. You need to be innovative while still delivering worth a penny.</p>
<p>According to McKinsey Global Institute data, only 1 out of 7 ideas result in a successful product, and the failure rates for newly launched products are between 25%-45%. Using a structured approach, you’ll stand a greater chance of avoiding any pitfalls resulting in your new product’s failure.</p>
<p>As said by late Apple founder Steve Jobs: “People are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”</p>
<p>But that does not guarantee that the new product will sell like hotcakes. You need to invest time with good command of customer &amp; market needs, your competitors, and offering products with clear value to beat the odds.</p>
<p><strong>This is where the 7 Stages Of Product Development Help:</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20074 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839.png" alt=" Stages Of Product Development " width="2048" height="368" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839.png 2048w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-300x54.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-1024x184.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-768x138.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-e1622189231839-1536x276.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involving customers at the early stage helps NPD process and understand their problem before executing ideas into process, tools, and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Necessity leads to invention. That’s where the New Product development Process(NDP) will help. A very simplified process to convert ideas into a tested concept into viable products and eliminate non-feasible ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where the </span><strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/stages-of-new-product-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">new product development process (</a></strong>NDP<strong>)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes into play. This process is designed to aid the conversion of new and untested concepts into viable products and market them while allowing you to weed out non-feasible ideas.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Is New Product Development?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New product development is all about converting an idea into a business-strategic workable software development product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Product Development (NPD) process involves researching existing products in the market with a customer-centric approach, feasibility of the idea, delivering working software and latching on the market opportunities, and delivering working software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product development is an umbrella term that covers six stages of SDLC and working and has a POC. The</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Product Development</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">approach revolves around an entirely new idea, where the uncertainty around its development and the next option remains high. Software</span> product development companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">are progressively exploring NPD facets to address development glitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is about releasing the latest software product, you should seek services from leading </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/outsource-software-product-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">software product development services</a><b>;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then, always a fair <strong>idea</strong> to join hands with leading firms.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 1: Idea Generation</b></h2>
<p><strong>Emphasize On Customer Problems: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good entrepreneur can scan the issues faced by the target audiences.  You can always identify the issues the customer is facing.</span></p>
<h3><strong>a) Personal Roadblocks</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you&#8217;re an entrepreneur or a buyer, the customer&#8217;s tendency always remains the same. All you need to do is prioritize one problem, derive a solution, and tag it” one for all. If you’re looking to set the tone right before product development, subscribing to </span>product design and development companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">could help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to apply your brain behind digital offerings. The communication gap often leads to many problems&#8212;&#8211; and is the biggest hurdle towards the path to productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a product and launching it can have some ups and downs, but there should focus on making up a great business idea.</span></p>
<h3><b>b) </b><b>Qualify Each Of The Listed Problems</b></h3>
<p><b>Here is the 4 U strategy:</b></p>
<p>Let’s discuss each of these aspects in detail.</p>
<p><b>Unworkable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out whether the brainstormed product concepts will address some real problems. Will the product be able to fill the existing customer experience gaps and will achieve product-market fit?</span></p>
<p><b>Unavoidable: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the problem that you are working on inevitable to the extent that it becomes mandatory to comply? You need to find out whether solving that problem is a choice or a compulsion.</span></p>
<p><b>Urgent:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is the problem urgent and is highly demandable by the target market? If the answer is affirmative, this could be your chance to cover the white space in the market with your original product.</span></p>
<p><b>Underserved: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there no available products that address the existing user problems? Look for the whitespace in the market and hold on to the idea that looks promising.</span></p>
<h3><b>c) </b><b>Emerging With Possible Solutions </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the problem gets figured out, you can start looking for possible solutions with a </span>product development firm <span style="font-weight: 400;">to produce feasible solutions. For every new user problem, there’ll be a new NPD service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have figured out the problem, it’s time to look for possible solutions. For every user problem, there ought to be potential new product development opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the workflow that starts from a problem and ends up with strategizing around the solution.</span></p>
<h3><b>d) Narrowing Down The Problems</b></h3>
<p>Categorize all shortlisted problems using a comparison chart with solutions<b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Circulate the findings across the organizational structure to come up with a viable problem set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case stakeholders are reserved, you can Replicate, Re-purpose, and with an upgrade approach.</span></p>
<p><b>Replicate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  You can create a similar product with. a competitor and launch it in the new market conditions. Once MVP(Minimum Viable Product) is launched, then you should prioritize out-of-the-box features.</span></p>
<p><b>Re-Purpose</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  You can rewire the existing business model and present it in the most viable manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It focuses on rewiring an existing business model—for instance, LinkedIn Learning &amp; e-learning platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Upgrading: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This concept of NPD revolves around the existing model with some improvements. Be it performance, speed, or addressing challenges of competitors with added functionalities. </span></p>

<hr />
<h2><b>Stage 2: Idea Screening</b><b>      </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new product development stage is about choosing the idea that gives you the highest potential for success. You can put all your ideas collectively for internal review, i.e., seek the advice of people with industry knowledge and experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When developing a new product idea, leverage the advantage of POC (Proof of Concept) to check the feasibility of the concept. One can’t zero on an idea that is not technically feasible to build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can consult the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/on-demand-teams/why-startups-choose-dedicated-teams-for-agile-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Agile development teams</a>&#8212;&#8211;expertise helps understand the technical side of things and helps shortlist ideas worth building a PoC. In India, </span>software product development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> leading-age technology solutions give the prospects a smooth development experience</span></p>
<p><b>SWOT (</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities &amp; Threats</span><b>) </b>is prevalent and good practice while shortlisting New Product development ideas.</p>
<p>The agile development team, product owner, scrum master, and product manager go through a detailed analysis and shortlist ideas&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; opportunities and strengths, threats picture and weaknesses.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a SWOT is relatively simple, and you need a simple 2×2 grid to get started:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWOT Analysis Template | New Product Development</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all, your New Product Development idea should be unique so that you do not have to convince people to pay for it.</span></p>

<h2><b>Stage 3: Concept Development &amp; Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluation of value proposition is the first step towards testing and development. It ensures you assess the problem in advance and can course-correct earlier. It saves from piling new technical debts.</span></p>
<p><b>These steps easy-to-follow steps include :</b></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantifying gain/pain Ratio</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting a competitor analysis </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enlisting major product features</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a value proposition chart</span></span></li>

<h2><b>Stage 4: Value Proposition Strategy </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great asset of </span>product development companies in India <span style="font-weight: 400;">before they launch any product. You should be very particular about the capabilities of new products. Once you are good to go with the idea’s utility, you can pitch it clearly to the end-user. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It ensures that a product or service positions around customer exact values and needs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the form of a </span>value proposition<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can showcase what your product is capable of doing.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20135" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.png" alt=" value proposition" width="566" height="276" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.png 850w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4-300x146.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4-768x374.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<h2><b>Stage 5:Concept Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are ready with the proposition in </span>software product development<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can now present it to the set of selected customers. The key is to have trust and belief in your ideas. Since the concept doesn’t look promising, you’ll repeat steps to develop a new project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get meaningful insight by focusing on four critical aspects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identification of the focus group, i.e., people who would benefit from the new product under development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessment of other alternatives to be offered to the focus group</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Devising a foolproof plan for the New Product Development right from features, marketing, pricing, and distribution</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integration of unique product features into the customer’s mind for findability and discoverability.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Stage 6: Product Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span>product development software companies<span style="font-weight: 400;"> start, execution of ideas occurs, the business strategy is documented &#8212;- you can go ahead with the product development cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Product Development starts with developing the prototype followed by MVP.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Prototype</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creation of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/product-ui-ux-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">UI/UX of the product</a> and share with the stakeholders helps visualize the product’s feasibility in the marketplace.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</b></h3>
<p>Using Agile for the new products gives a different look.  Once the product goes through the design &amp; steps &#8212; the product gets launched with minimal features.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agile Product development is better than conventional. The waterfall model complements the to-and-fro movement across the development cycle and ideal for last-time changes.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20137" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.png" alt="" width="435" height="326" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Maintaining Communication &amp; Synchronization are the key highlights of Agile Model</b></p>
<h2><b>Stage 7: Market Testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps in New Product Development aims to reduce the uncertainty revolving around the </span>software product development<span style="font-weight: 400;">, i.e., checking the viability of the new product or its marketing campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>There are two market testing strategies to follow:</b></p>
<h3><b>1. Alpha Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of testing allows testing engineers to judge any product based on performance and map the marketing mix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of any issues, the changes are planned and implemented before the final go-ahead.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Beta Testing</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The selected group of customers gives unbiased feedback to the organization. It is all about listening to customers’ voices when issuing a move back to the development team for fixtures.</span></p>
<p><b>Here’s how Alpha and Beta testing are different from each other:</b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-20139" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf.png" alt="" width="513" height="471" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf.png 750w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fgsghf-300x276.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px" /></p>
<p>The third form of testing conveyed product validation and is called In-Home Usage Test (IIHUT). Development products are meant for intended customers who will use the products.</p>

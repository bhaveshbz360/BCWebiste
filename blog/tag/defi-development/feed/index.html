										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital asset industry is booming and is only going to continue to grow in the coming years. As businesses look for ways to tap into this market, blockchain technology is proving to be a key solution for digital assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are becoming more and more popular due to the rise of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens. Enterprises that engage in digital assets have a significant opportunity to deliver meaningful value to their customers with new service and business models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, many businesses still don&#8217;t know how to take advantage of digital assets and blockchain technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to understand digital assets in blockchain because enterprises take it as an alternative investment, capital raising tool, and transactional medium (when used as money). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not sure why you should care about digital assets in blockchain, read on as we discuss how digital assets in blockchain could help your enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>In this article, we&#8217;ll explore how digital assets use in enterprise blockchain applications.</b></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Digital Assets: A Brief Along With Examples</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital assets in blockchain, called crypto tokens or crypto assets, are a special type of assets that usually exist on top of one or more blockchains, the most well-known being the bitcoin blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of different ways to create digital assets. One common way is to use blockchain app development services. In the blockchain, a digital asset is called a &#8220;token.&#8221; Tokens can be used to represent anything that has value, including money, goods, or services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can also be used to represent other tokens. This creates a system in which digital assets can be traded and used to represent value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital assets offer a number of advantages over traditional assets. They are easier to store and transport, and they can be divided into smaller units without losing value. They also have the potential to provide more security and privacy than traditional assets.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Different Types of Digital Assets For Blockchain</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different types of digital assets in the blockchain. The most common type of digital asset is a cryptocurrency, which has to purchase goods and services or trade for other assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other types of digital assets include tokens, digital contracts, and digital identities. Each type of digital asset has its own unique characteristics and use in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that use cryptography to secure their transactions and to control the creation of new units. Decentralized Cryptocurrencies are not subject to government or financial institution control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009. Ethereum, another popular cryptocurrency, was created in 2015. Cryptocurrencies often trade on decentralized exchanges and can also be used to purchase goods and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokens are digital assets that represent a fungible or non-fungible asset. Tokens represent different things, such as digital currency, loyalty points, or access rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum is the most well-known platform for creating and issuing tokens. Tokens trade on decentralized exchanges or used to purchase goods and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital contracts are digital assets that encode agreements between parties. Digital contracts represent anything from simple agreements, such as a loan agreement, to more complex ones, such as a smart contract. </span></p>
<p><em><b>Ethereum is the most well-known platform for creating and issuing digital contracts.</b></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Digital identities are digital assets that represent a person, organization, or thing. Digital identities can be used to log in to online accounts, sign documents, or access services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here also, Ethereum is the most well-known platform for creating and issuing digital identities. Digital identities can be stored on a blockchain or off-chain.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Ways How Digital Assets Can Be Used In Blockchain Apps</b></span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-24189 size-large aligncenter" title="INLINE investors guide digital assets" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/INLINE-investors-guide-digital-assets-1024x576.webp" alt="INLINE investors guide digital assets" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/INLINE-investors-guide-digital-assets-1024x576.webp 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/INLINE-investors-guide-digital-assets-300x169.webp 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/INLINE-investors-guide-digital-assets-768x432.webp 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/INLINE-investors-guide-digital-assets-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/INLINE-investors-guide-digital-assets-2048x1152.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; One of the most obvious ways to use digital assets in a business setting is to store them on a blockchain. This can provide security and transparency for companies that want to track their digital assets. Blockchain technology creates digital asset wallets, which allow users to store and manage their digital assets securely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Another way to use digital assets in the enterprise is by using them as payment tokens. For example, a business could use digital assets to pay its suppliers or employees. This can help reduce the cost of transactions and make the payment process more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Digital assets can also be used to power decentralized applications (dApps). dApps are becoming more and more popular and they offer a number of benefits over traditional applications. By using digital assets as tokens on dApps, businesses can take advantage of these benefits and improve their operations.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>New Business Opportunities Around Digital Assets</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital assets are becoming more and more popular, as blockchain technology continues to evolve. There are a number of business opportunities around digital assets, which include:</span></p>
<p><strong>Trading platforms</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital assets trade on specialized platforms, similar to traditional stock exchanges.</span></p>
<p><strong>Payment processors</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital assets pay for goods and services, just like traditional currency.</span></p>
<p><strong>Investment vehicles</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital assets can invest in a number of different ways, including through blockchain-based startups and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).</span></p>
<p><strong>Decentralized applications</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital assets can be used to power blockchain-based applications, which are becoming more and more popular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of these opportunities presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities. For example, trading platforms need to ensure that they are able to handle the high volume of transactions, while payment processors need to be able to quickly and easily process payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, blockchain-based startups need to be able to demonstrate the value of their digital assets in order to attract investors.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Few Security Risks And Compliance Requirements</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any new technology, there are security risks and compliance requirements to consider before implementing a blockchain solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain is a distributed database, meaning that data is stored across a network of computers rather than a single server. This makes it difficult for hackers to gain access to the data, as they would need to hack into all of the computers on the network. However, blockchain is not infallible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2018, a cryptocurrency mining company called NiceHash was hacked, resulting in the loss of 4,700 Bitcoin, worth around $60 million at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that are looking to use blockchain for digital assets need to ensure that they have appropriate security measures in place to protect their investment. These may include firewalls, anti-virus software, and password protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, businesses need to be aware of compliance requirements specific to the blockchain. For example, in some jurisdictions, businesses need to register their blockchain solution with the relevant authorities. Failure to do so may result in fines or imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses should also ensure that they have a good understanding of blockchain technology before implementing it. Blockchain is a complex technology, and there is a lot of misinformation out there. It&#8217;s important to get advice from an expert before making any decisions.</span></p>

<h2>Here Are Some Important Things To Know About Digital Asset Management (Dam) And Blockchain</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Digital Assets go beyond media files</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of digital assets as anything that lives in a computer or other device and has value to an organization—from word processing documents to medical images, financial data, or design specs. That said, blockchain isn’t just for storing large amounts of data—it can also handle metadata for any type of file. </span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><strong> Blockchain isn’t just about transactions</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people think of blockchain when they hear bitcoin, but bitcoin is just one application on top of blockchain technology that enables transactions between parties without needing an intermediary like a bank or government body. And blockchain doesn’t have to involve money—other applications include smart contracts, supply chain management, and identity verification. </span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><strong> Blockchain isn’t blockchain without distributed ledgers</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term blockchain refers to a chain of blocks that contain information related to digital assets. Each block contains information about who owns what when each transaction occurred, and whether it was successful or not (hence why it needs consensus). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are different types of blockchains with different properties depending on their use case including public vs private blockchains, permissioned vs permissionless blockchains, federated vs decentralized blockchains. </span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><strong> Blockchain requires a network</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain requires multiple nodes to reach a consensus on new transactions before adding them to its ledger. It acts as a series of trusted nodes working together instead of trusting one central entity such as a bank or clearinghouse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nodes can either run on dedicated hardware devices called blockchain infrastructure solutions or software installed locally by individual users. When using blockchain for digital assets, organizations often set up nodes using infrastructure solutions from vendors such as IBM and Oracle. </span></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3><strong> Blockchain is still evolving</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology is still in its infancy, which means it will take time for enterprises to figure out how best to leverage blockchain for digital assets. However, blockchain offers many benefits over legacy systems, such as more secure transactions and reduced costs due to automation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some experts say blockchain could save banks $20 billion per year through improved efficiency, others say it will take at least five years before enterprises adopt blockchain at scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This uncertainty makes sense given that blockchain itself is still evolving – remember, Bitcoin first launched back in 2009! &#8211; so, businesses will need time to experiment with different use cases and figure out where blockchain fits into their broader strategy. </span></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3><strong> Blockchain can help solve real problems</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As blockchain technology evolves, it will become a viable solution for digital assets in areas such as intellectual property rights management, patient records, and even voting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies are already exploring ways to apply blockchain to digital assets, including: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> International Business Machines Corp. is building a platform for digital rights management. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amazon Web Services Inc. is developing a cloud service for storing and tracking digital assets. · EY recently conducted a proof of concept that used blockchain to verify an insurance claim.</span></span></li>

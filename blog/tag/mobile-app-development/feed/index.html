<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter, a groundbreaking open-source initiative by Google, is at the forefront of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/cross-platform-app-development-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>cross-platform mobile app development</strong></a>. Its dedication to crafting high-performance applications and suitability for various operating systems sets it apart. </span></p>
<p><b>How does it achieve this?</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its core, Flutter relies on a few key pillars that make it a standout choice:</span></i></p>
<p><b>Widgets: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter revolves around the concept of widgets. These are like building blocks for creating the user interface of your app. They can be simple elements like buttons or text fields or complex layouts like navigation drawers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter provides an extensive library of customizable widgets, making it easier for developers to design visually appealing and consistent UIs across different platforms.</span></p>
<p><b>Hot Reloading: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a game-changer for developers. Hot reloading lets you instantly view the changes in your code in real-time, without rebuilding the entire app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means you can experiment, tweak, and fine-tune your app&#8217;s appearance and behavior on the fly, significantly speeding up the development process.</span></p>
<p><b>Dart Programming Language: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter is unique in its choice of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dart</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programming language. While Dart may not be as widely known as JavaScript, it offers a range of advantages. It is easy to learn and has a clean, modern syntax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dart&#8217;s &#8220;ahead-of-time&#8221; (AOT) compilation also contributes to Flutter&#8217;s impressive performance and allows for efficient execution on both Android and iOS platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, Flutter&#8217;s focus on widgets, hot reloading, and its use of the Dart language make it a robust and developer-friendly framework for creating high-performance cross-platform mobile apps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing between Flutter and React Native ultimately depends on your project&#8217;s specific needs and objectives. Let&#8217;s explore when each framework might be better:</span></p>
<h3><strong>Performance Matters:</strong></h3>
<p><b><i>Flutter:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Opt for Flutter if you need top-notch performance, especially in graphics and animations. It excels in creating visually stunning, high-performance UIs.</span></p>
<p><b><i>React Native:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If your app doesn&#8217;t rely heavily on intricate animations and requires good, but not necessarily top-tier performance, React Native could be the more practical choice.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Code Maintainability:</strong></h3>
<p><b><i>React Native:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For developers already comfortable with JavaScript, React Native offers a smoother learning curve. Choose it if code maintainability is your priority.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Flutter:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutter&#8217;s Dart language may seem unfamiliar, but its clean and modern syntax can be worth the learning curve if you seek a more streamlined development process.</span></p>
<h3><strong>User Experience and UI Control:</strong></h3>
<p><b><i>React Native:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If your app needs to reuse UI elements and components from web applications, React Native provides an edge. It integrates seamlessly with React&#8217;s vast community support.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Flutter:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you require complete UI control and unique, high-performance graphics, Flutter&#8217;s custom widgets and layouts make it the better choice.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Development Time:</strong></h3>
<p><b><i>React Native:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re building an app with complex features and need a shorter development cycle, React Native&#8217;s simplicity could be your time-saver.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Flutter:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For swifter app development with fewer UI elements and complex animations, Flutter&#8217;s instant code changes via hot reloading can accelerate the process.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Type of Apps:</strong></h3>
<p><b><i>Flutter:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Opt for Flutter when developing business or productivity apps requiring push notifications, high performance, and smooth animations. Flutter shines in this space.</span></p>
<p><b><i>React Native:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If your app leans towards customization in <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/product-ui-ux-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>UI/UX design</strong></a> and requires advanced animation effects, React Native may be the more fitting choice.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Scalability:</strong></h3>
<p><b><i>React Native:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">When scalability is a top concern, React Native&#8217;s flexibility and large community support make it a dependable choice for expanding your application.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Flutter:</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">While Flutter is incredibly efficient, scaling apps may require more effort due to its unique compilation into platform-specific binaries.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can accommodate many learners simultaneously, ensuring consistent access to learning resources. Additionally, employees can engage with the training content at their own pace and convenience, allowing flexibility and minimizing disruptions to daily operations.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Customization &amp; Personalization:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An eLearning application enables businesses to customize training content based on their specific industry, company culture, and learning objectives. Tailoring the content ensures relevance and alignment with the organization&#8217;s goals and values. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Student Learning Management Systems often provide personalized learning paths, allowing employees to focus on areas that require improvement and progress at their preferred speed, leading to enhanced knowledge retention and skill development.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Standardization of Training:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maintaining consistency in training across different departments and locations can be challenging for businesses. eLearning applications offer a centralized platform to deliver standardized training content and assessments. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ensures that all employees get the same quality of information, eliminating discrepancies and improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of training programs.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Real-time Performance Tracking and Analytics:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> An eLearning application provides businesses valuable insights into employees&#8217; learning progress and performance through real-time tracking and analytics. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administrators can monitor learner engagement, track completion rates, and identify knowledge gaps. These data-driven insights enable targeted interventions, personalized feedback, and continuous improvement of training programs, leading to enhanced employee development and increased productivity.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Accessibility &amp; Continuous Learning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: eLearning applications promote accessibility to training materials, enabling employees to access them from any location and at any time. This fosters a culture of continuous learning, empowering employees to acquire new skills and knowledge. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees can address specific challenges or seek information whenever needed with just-in-time learning resources, boosting their problem-solving capabilities and adaptability.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Engaging and Interactive Learning Experience</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Traditional training methods can sometimes be less engaging, reducing learner motivation and knowledge retention. eLearning applications leverage multimedia elements, interactive quizzes, and gamification techniques to create an immersive and engaging learning experience. This interactive approach enhances learner engagement, enjoyment, and overall effectiveness of the training process.</span></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Microlearning: Bite-Sized Nuggets of Knowledge</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an era where attention spans wane and time becomes an ever-precious commodity, microlearning has emerged as a beacon of efficiency. E-learning platforms can cater to learners&#8217; needs for quick, digestible content by breaking down complex concepts into bite-sized knowledge nuggets. This trend ensures learners can acquire knowledge at their own pace, fitting seamlessly into their busy lives.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gamification: Infusing Learning with Playful Engagement</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning no longer needs to be a mundane endeavor; it can be transformed into an interactive &amp; immersive experience through gamification. By introducing game-like elements such as points, badges, leaderboards, and challenges, eLearning platforms can captivate learners&#8217; attention, foster healthy competition, and inject fun into the educational journey.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Personalization: Tailoring the Learning Experience</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization is one of the secrets to successful eLearning apps. Every learner has unique needs, preferences, and learning styles. eLearning platforms can offer personalized recommendations, adaptive assessments, and tailored learning paths. </span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">1) Find out users’ likes &amp; dislikes: <span style="color: #ffffff;">Mobile App Development Tips</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8572" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_198608201.eps_.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="390" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_198608201.eps_.jpg 690w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_198608201.eps_-600x339.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_198608201.eps_-300x170.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, even if you have invested many nights and days to build a mobile application people are still not bound to use your app if that does not encourage them. They will have no excitement with the app if it does not help them in monetary terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very crucial for you to check the likes and dislikes of your mobile app status on Google or the app store. You will be required to perform deep research to build an app that motivates users and sets off their interests in a better way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A key step in mobile app development is gathering feedback about your idea from real users. Talking to customers and testing apps early will give you a much better sense of whether people want what you’re planning to build—and help you figure out how to make it better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have an idea for an application, there are many ways that you can test it with potential users before investing too much time and money into building something no one wants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re building an app for multiple platforms, conduct user research. The way people use their phones and tablets differs widely—and so do their preferences for apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, mobile web users are more likely than native app users to visit retail sites like Amazon or eBay; in contrast, mobile game players favor apps over mobile web pages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, your customer personas will likely look different depending on designing a website or a mobile application. You may even want to consider forming separate personas for other devices!</span></p>

<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"> 2) Right platforms and features:<span style="color: #ffffff;"> Mobile App Development Tips</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are clear with your users’ likes and dislikes, you need to decide on your app features and platform. The aesthetics and appearance of the application work differently on different platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, you will need to study the target platform, functions, and specific parameters to make the application appropriate.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to content and user interface, choosing the right technical features, such as integrating the <a href="https://messente.com/blog/best-sms-gateway" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">best SMS gateway</a> for apps requiring robust messaging functionalities, is crucial for a great user experience. If it does not have some basic features to make it useful to the user, it will be quickly uninstalled from the phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, you need to develop applications that are simple yet functional. However, there are many ways you can add extra features like social media integration or push notifications, which can also increase your revenue potential.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mobile app development company should provide valuable insights on which platform would work best for your business needs and suggest practical ways to create a compelling app that users will love using.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need expert Mobile app developers for all these things, as developing an app requires extensive knowledge about design patterns for different platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, you also need help in determining what type of information should go into your mobile app so that it becomes successful among your target audience.</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/contact?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=mobileapptips_8561&amp;utm_campaign=webblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15066" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mobile-app.jpg" alt="mobile app development" width="810" height="152" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mobile-app.jpg 810w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mobile-app-300x56.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mobile-app-768x144.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></a></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">3 ) Offline Friendliness: <span style="color: #ffffff;">Mobile App Development Tips</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8567" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline.jpg" alt="Youtubeoffline" width="1368" height="912" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline.jpg 1368w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Youtubeoffline-960x640.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1368px) 100vw, 1368px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, it is a new trend in the development of mobile applications that is getting the attention of both companies and developers. It is the way an app behaves when there is no Internet connection available.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more patrons turn to their smartphones and tablets for entertainment, news, social networking, and information about local businesses, your app must work well without an internet connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going offline means you can still offer a top-notch experience to users who don&#8217;t have cell service or are in remote areas with no coverage at all. Make sure to include local information on your app to find nearby places or things of interest-based on where they are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try using geolocation features that automatically detect users&#8217; locations to see what&#8217;s around them even when there&#8217;s no internet connection. It&#8217;s one big thing that makes applications successful these days.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">4) Make simple apps just like a smartphone</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Smartphones are a sensation. From a toddler to an old person, everyone can use it. This makes its target audience even bigger. Just like a smartphone, your app has to be simple. It will not only expand your reach but also users will keep coming back.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to build an app for your start-up or new business, it can be tempting to try and create something overly complex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s possible to create a hit game or social media platform, it’s more likely that you’ll end up with a mediocre product that nobody wants. Instead of reinventing the wheel and making something too complicated, focus on making simple apps instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For example, if you run a small retail store in New York City, consider creating an app that allows customers to check out their favorite products while they shop in your store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may not seem like much of a big deal at first glance, but by making things easier for people who already like what you have to offer—and by providing them some kind of incentive—you could see significant results in no time at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as it’s easy to use and gives users something of value, you can be sure there will be plenty of interest.</span></p>

<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">5) Ads &amp; Banners: Keep it limited</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8568" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant.jpg" alt="ads-relevant" width="1050" height="657" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant.jpg 1050w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant-600x375.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant-768x481.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ads-relevant-960x601.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make it a successful custom mobile app development project, you need to avoid the overuse of ads and banners. A consumer can delete it anytime if he finds it is bothering his browsing experience. This is a very broad hint and not just a friendly tip! If your user finds the mobile screen too cluttered, they will certainly uninstall your app,</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So keep in mind that an ad banner should be limited to only one or two per page.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, try as much as possible to keep them on both sides of each corner so that users do not have problems with navigation while using the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another point worth noting here is to make sure that you choose advertisement services carefully because there are several ways through which developers can add ads and banners to their apps. The most popular ones include Admob, Mobclix, Adsense, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must understand how each of these ad networks works before deciding on a particular one for your application. The primary purpose of advertising services is to help mobile app development companies earn money from advertisements, so they need to ensure maximum visibility of ads on mobile screens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means more traffic for them and more irritation for users who do not want any disturbance while using their phones or tablets. So it’s up to you if you want maximum revenue or user satisfaction!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s your choice!</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">6) Customized Design:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are two leading mobile operating systems in the market i.e. Android and iOS. Both users have access in different ways. Ensure that your application complies with each operating system policy and fulfill their terms and conditions. You can also go for custom mobile app designs.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">7) Grid-based applications:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accept the grid design to ensure maximum consistency even when users move from page to page in the entire application. Experts will always adopt draft concepts based on grids in mobile application development projects.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be done by ensuring every element is fixed width and height and is aligned at every corner of a cell. It makes it simpler for </span>mobile app developers<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create applications that have uniform elements and avoid any kind of cluttering on each screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grid-based applications are more scalable as they allow users to resize elements without affecting other parts of an app&#8217;s interface. For example, if you want the application to appear larger on a tablet, you can simply increase its dimensions without affecting its content or layout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why </span><b>mobile app developers </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and designers usually prefer grid-based designs over fluid layouts with a fixed width and height but aren&#8217;t aligned at every corner.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing for mobile devices is easier for many people than designing for desktop computers because it forces them to focus on only one screen size. This makes it easier for them to create good apps across all devices rather than making multiple versions for different screen sizes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile apps also tend to be more accessible when compared with desktop apps because their interfaces don&#8217;t require scrolling or zooming to navigate from one page to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, they use buttons and tabs that make navigation easy even when using touchscreens, requiring users to interact with their screens using only their fingers instead of mouse pointers or keyboards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to stand out from other apps, it is important to make sure that you have an app description written by professional writers who can write it so well that they can convince users why they should download their app instead of another similar one. </span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">9) M-marketing is Gaining Traction</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, it is trending to market via apps. In the peak season, your product will need to go public/live. Develop and launch the app a little before that and script out the marketing strategies. Align them together for best results. Ensure to make use of optimization searches.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile marketing is becoming a high priority for companies of all sizes. Because smartphones and tablets allow for direct contact with consumers at any time, businesses can take full advantage of mobile marketing to make their sales funnel more efficient and boost their bottom line. Mobile applications are particularly effective in closing deals with customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, app users are three times more likely to purchase a mobile app than a desktop or laptop computer or tablet. Moreover, mobile devices have become extremely accurate data collection tools, allowing businesses to gain insight into customer behavior and drive sales accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart marketers understand that if they want success for their start-up company, they need to look beyond traditional advertising options and explore new tools that can make their business grow exponentially over time.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">10) One App For One Reason</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep your app focused only on a single problem. Any app needs to solve a single problem only and do that in an expert manner. Don’t make an app that can unzip files and become a torch and then let you excess to GPS and so on. This type of app never succeeds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An app with two or more functions is never as successful. Focus on solving one specific problem and have a successful app. Research your competitors&#8217; apps, take out their best features and make them better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that your app has its unique selling point to attract people to use it, but don’t make anything too complicated for users to understand. Keep it simple!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A simple app makes better design sense, but also simplicity helps your app from being complex or full of bugs, which means users are likely to stay there longer.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">11) Choose the right people</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Successful mobile application development depends fully on the developers. You should always emphasize hiring only veteran<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-ios-developers?utm_source=blog_amyra_rg121&amp;utm_medium=ios_8561&amp;utm_campaign=SME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> iOS</a> or <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-android-developers?utm_source=blog_amyra_rg121&amp;utm_medium=android_8561&amp;utm_campaign=SME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Android developers</a> who have specialized in at least one specific technology. It is better to hire Android developers with experience in producing high-quality mobile apps than look for someone who has a vague mixture of knowledge across several technologies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for iOS developers, as they need to be well versed with Objective C and Swift programming languages. If you are looking forward to creating an app that serves your business needs perfectly, you must find people who can deliver what you want within your time frame and budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to look for mobile app development experts is by conducting thorough research on various professional websites such as Clutch or Upwork. You should also take advantage of social media platforms like LinkedIn or Twitter, where you can follow professionals from different companies and industries and access their work experience details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, try reaching out to them via phone calls or emails before deciding whether or not to hire them based on their previous work experience, portfolio details, hourly rates, etc.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Bonus tips</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">12) Check out for new OS Updates</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be it Android or iOS, updates are important. A major update sometimes changes the entire landscape and if your app cannot meet the requirements, it would be a big issue. If you stay up-to-date, you can also help prevent the issues listed on the platform with the latest releases. Take a look at the improvements notes that capture the potential issues that will damage your success.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Apple recently released iOS 9.3, which includes support for Wi-Fi calling and new emojis. The company says that users should upgrade their devices to run all apps smoothly, but that is not always possible. Some apps may not function well until developers update them to support newer versions of iOS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But keep in mind that there are apps that may need to be updated before working with an upgraded OS version. This is because developers have to ensure that their apps run smoothly on older OS versions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you&#8217;re using an older device that runs an older version of iOS, you&#8217;ll need to wait for these app updates before upgrading your OS version to 9.3. Otherwise, some of your favorite apps might stop working once you do so!</span></p>

<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">13) Test properly</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8566" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/android_app_testing_specifics-01.png" alt="successful mobile app development" width="710" height="416" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/android_app_testing_specifics-01.png 710w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/android_app_testing_specifics-01-600x352.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/android_app_testing_specifics-01-300x176.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After all your efforts and long working hours if you do not test your app on every platform it would not be a success. While physical devices are used, you do have the option of testing on simulators for mobile devices.  Ironing out the bugs by running your app through a variety of device simulators helps you save time. It makes your app a success by improving the user experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing is also one of those areas where many entrepreneurs can cut corners to save money. You need to make sure that everything works as intended before going live. It means thoroughly testing your product or service with real users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re planning on releasing an app for iOS devices, then there are a few things that you should know. The first thing is that Apple has specific guidelines and rules regarding how apps are built, designed, and tested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to follow these rules will result in rejection from Apple’s App Store and potentially damage your reputation as an entrepreneur who cares about quality over quantity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should avoid testing on jailbroken devices if your business plans to charge for app downloads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jailbreaking installs apps from sources other than Apple’s official App Store. It causes problems with payment processing later down the line. If possible, test on non-jailbroken devices only!</span></p>

<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching a new app can be exciting for entrepreneurs and clients alike. Unfortunately, a lot more work goes into it than meets the eye. Creating something that people want takes plenty of hard work and endless hours, and launching your app is only one part of it.</span></p>

<h3><b>1. Swift Application Development</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xamarin tool is a powerful &amp; fast-developing program that allows you to create customized apps for your business. Built using C# language and Visual Studio, it has cross-platform compatibility, which helps speed up development time significantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While with other tools out there, such as Android Kits or Unity 3D plugin, you would have to compromise with the quality! Therefore, businesses prefer this platform to create cross-platform apps.</span></p>
<p>Thus, you must <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-xamarin-developers?utm_source=webblog-23585-whyxamarin&amp;utm_medium=S05" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Hire Xamarin Developers</a> to create your cross-platform business application.</p>
<h3><b>2. Seamless Cross-Platform Application Development</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xamarin is a reliable and easy-to-use app development platform that takes less time than other platforms. Not just, does it allow you to develop apps for iOS, Android, and Windows, but also many more systems through Mono support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, no matter what kind of device or operating system your users are using, they will be able to get access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In brief, the <a href="/best-xamarin-development-services-company-india" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Xamarin app development</a> process is less time-consuming than other options. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can do cross-platform app development with a single code that works on multiple mobile platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Therefore, it takes much less effort to create your product or service. Moreover, developing apps on Xamarin is relatively simple compared to other platforms because it uses C# and the .NET framework. It makes apps a trustworthy environment for all mobile devices!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you want to curve the hassles of application development, you must pick Xamarin for cross-platform app development. </span></p>
<h3><b>3. Code </b>Re-usability</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xamarin is a unique and exciting cross-platform framework that lets you share business logic between mobile platforms. This means less time spent on maintaining existing code, as well as the ability to make changes more easily in future projects.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-23589 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/why-choose-xamarin.png" alt="why choose xamarin" width="512" height="249" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/why-choose-xamarin.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/why-choose-xamarin-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.appfutura.com/blog/advantages-of-using-xamarin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Image source</span> </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And! You don&#8217;t need to develop an application twice! Besides, with Visual Studio&#8217;s built-in support for iOS/Android development (and many other tools), developing apps has never been simple or safer than it would be otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that one of Xamarin&#8217;s greatest strengths is its Write Once, Run Everywhere (WORE) app model. This means you can share projects between operating systems, and developers have more control over their UX!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea here is if someone has written all this cool code for us, we should be able to use it as many times without worrying about getting unexpected runtime errors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, Xamarin for cross-platform app development is the best pick. Furthermore, you must hire </span>Xamarin developers<span style="font-weight: 400;"> that understand your need to fulfill your purpose.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/a-complete-timeline-guide-for-web-app-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">A Complete Timeline Guide For Web App Development</a></p>
<hr />
<h3><b>4. Safe &amp; Secure</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authenticity is key when it comes to securing your app. This means you can rely on end-to-end encryption and authentication services like Azure Key Vault or Active Directory for cross-platform </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, it doesn&#8217;t require costly misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the process. Therefore, I recommend using code signing capabilities within Visual Studio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you can ensure authenticity across all devices; if signed by Microsoft, then we know what&#8217;s good!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, cross-platform development isn&#8217;t always easy, but tools like these make the process much simpler by bridging gaps between libraries used for different platforms.</span></p>

<h3><b>5. On-Time, On Budget</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xamarin offers a unique and attractive benefit for</span> Xamarin developers<span style="font-weight: 400;"> who want to speed up their software projects while decreasing costs. Besides, developers no longer need to worry about cross-platform support, as it&#8217;s built right into the language at its core: C#!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means that mobile apps can be developed faster than ever before because of familiarity with source codes across different platforms. It saves both time and money when creating new work from scratch instead of using existing libraries or frameworks.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RcAslmVkfL4?si=cy8bYZWYc9yIhhUr" width="1080" height="520" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

This program offers highly customizable, professional software at an affordable price, with all updates provided in perpetuity!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every business looking into Xamarin, there are two major reasons why they should choose this option. Firstly because it&#8217;s easy, secondly you won&#8217;t have any worries about your investment going missing since everything gets updated automatically every time anything changes within our app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of a community is what has prevented more people from trying out Xamarin. However, it has great customer support with detailed documentation and training facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this makes it easier for new users to use the platform. But! Xamarin doesn&#8217;t offer any incentives or promotions if you sign up through them instead of another provider like Microsoft Studios (which gives access not just to their own products).</span></p>
<h3><b>7. Native UI Toolkit Support</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xamarin is a peculiar mobile app development platform that provides you with complete access to native APIs and tools for all three major platforms: Android, iOS (iPad), &amp; Windows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means your application will provide a high-quality experience no matter what device consumers are using!</span></p>
<h3><b>8. Support</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xamarin&#8217;s cross-platform mobile app development platform offers developers a way to build high-quality apps for Android and iOS, with their favorite tools in C# or Visual Basic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With real-time multiplayer support as well as cloud storage options available out of the box, you can be sure that your OpenSocial game will work great no matter where it goes!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, it is critical to say that you must pick Xamarin for cross-platform app development. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ve got an idea, and it&#8217;s time to build it into an app that will wow your customers. The first &amp; foremost question you might ask yourself is, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What android libraries should I use to help me make this?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here are tons of</span><b> high-performing libraries </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">out there, &amp; you could spend days researching them all.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Before you do that, though, stop and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">think about your needs. </strong>Do you have special needs? Or are you just looking for something generic? Your answers to these questions will help shape how you approach choosing a library.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If speed is essential, don’t go with a slow library that does everything under the sun just because it’s got every feature in existence — and if something goes wrong down the line, be prepared to work with what’s already in place instead of dropping everything and looking for alternatives.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Check out these Essential Android Libraries &amp; Start Planning your Next Android App Today!</span></strong></em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>Let’s discuss them in detail.</strong></p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">1. Dagger 2- Simplifying Dependency Injection</span></strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-30996 " title="image19" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image19.jpg" alt="image19" width="996" height="498" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image19.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image19-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Dependency injection is a process whereby one object provides another object with its services. It’s often used in software development to make code more maintainable and testable. Luckily, Google released an open-source library called Dagger 2 that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">makes dependency injection easier </strong>for Android developers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Even if you’re not using Dagger 2 for your project, it can be helpful to understand how to implement dependency injection manually. That way, you can benefit even if your organization isn’t ready to adopt a third-party library.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">As long as you have a firm hold of dependency injection in general, it shouldn’t be too hard to implement it in your app.</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Injecting dependencies makes your code more testable by removing hard-coded dependencies. In general, injection helps make your classes less tightly coupled, making them easier to maintain and more straightforward to unit test.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It also improves modularity because you can swap out implementations without modifying classes that use them.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Additionally, a dependency-injected service is easy to unit test in isolation since it gets provided with a mocked implementation during testing.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It saves you from worrying about where a particular object came from when being used in place of another thing since all references get captured in one place.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It can significantly reduce confusion when coming back to old code or determining why something isn’t working when debugging your app or testing it under various conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cons:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">It can be challenging to understand and utilize. Also, since dependency injection has many different features, there is a learning curve for understanding its intricacies.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">While performance won’t suffer with it, if your app’s dependencies are large or numerous, you might find them hurting performance.</li>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">2. Retrofit- Smoothens HTTP Communication</span></strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-31001 aligncenter" title="image23" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image23.jpg" alt="image23" width="976" height="488" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image23.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image23-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is among the top Android libraries that </span><b>simplifies HTTP communication</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and enables your app to consume RESTful web services.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Retrofit can be an excellent tool to get the job done if you&#8217;re looking to take advantage of backend APIs.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Its idea was to make it easier for developers to send HTTP requests and parse responses without dealing with low-level networking code.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is also an excellent choice when connecting an Android app to a backend on services. For example, Facebook or Twitter then Retrofit is undoubtedly the right option for you.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Retrofit is an HTTP client library for Android.</li>

<p class="graf graf--p">EventBus, also known as GreenRobot EventBus, is an Android library with the primary objective of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">delivering events between different application components.</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, activities, fragments, services, etc., according to the EventBus GitHub page. EventBus can save you time &amp; energy by acting as the middleman between multiple classes in your app.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, it may not be the perfect library for all projects. Depending on your needs, there are several ways to use EventBus effectively — or not so effectively — and let’s explore them.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">EventBus makes it easy to decouple different components of your application.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Different event handlers don’t need to worry about each other — instead, they just need to know how to respond to a given type of event.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">They also don’t need any shared context or data structure to give them information about their siblings or cause problems if misused.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being among the top android libraries it ensures fewer potential errors. </span></li>

<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">The biggest problem with using EventBus is that it has an asynchronous nature. It means that when you register to listen for events in your Android Application, your application will become unresponsive. It will continue until an event arrives.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">If you are running in a foreground service or your app is in full-screen mode on a device with notifications enabled, Android will display a persistent message. It will keep on asking if you would like to receive alerts when new events occur.</li>

<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stetho is among the top Android libraries providing a debug bridge to the Android framework and its Native Libraries. It allows you to</span><b> debug your application </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">without adding any code or configuration changes.</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It works on Android 2.3+ and uses only standard Java Native Interface (JNI) calls to provide access to native activities such as accessing thread information, retrieving log messages, and dumping the application heap.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In a nutshell, Stetho is a debugging bridge for Android applications, allowing for debugging data to be viewed in Chrome Developer Tools. It lets you see what’s going on inside your app without having to install it on a device or emulator.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">It allows for higher quality snapshots of your app’s information by executing on the device, rather than just getting data that you have stored on your phone or tablet already.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Gives you more flexibility for profiling and general development within your mobile app environment on an active mobile device.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It doesn’t give off all of your network traffic over Wi-Fi without having to put some effort into it yourself.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Developers also means less time debugging networking problems and more visibility into memory use.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It provides better performance through faster runtimes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cons:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">It has a few minor performance issues that make it unusable for some applications.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">The library itself can cause unexpected crashes due to memory leaks. It is particularly concerning if you have native code which uses STL algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">14. Square- Managing Online Payments</span></strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-31003 aligncenter" title="image25" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image25.jpg" alt="image25" width="976" height="488" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image25.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image25-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" /></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Though it’s not commonly available in native Android apps, most developers are familiar with Square because these <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">APIs are ubiquitous in accepting payments.</strong> So, what is Square?</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">According to the official definition, it is an elegant solution that empowers anyone to accept card payments using a simple device or tablet. It makes accepting card payments easy. So, you can focus on selling products or services rather than collecting payment information manually.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Thus it proves beneficial in saving time, reducing errors, and freeing up your staff from a day-to-day activity that distracts them from their core tasks.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">It’s open-source, so you can see exactly how it works.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Quick, easy payments — it’s never been easier to accept credit cards on an app.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Fraud detection services to keep your business secure.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It works with all major gateways.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It maintains PCI compliance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cons:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">It has no publicly available interface, meaning you can’t make changes to its code.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">When your customer base grows, you’ll be stuck having to either continue using Square or use another credit card processor.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">15. Lottie- For Smooth Animation</span></strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-30998 aligncenter" title="image20" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image20.jpg" alt="image20" width="978" height="489" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image20.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image20-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Lottie is an Android library that can help<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> bring Vector Drawables to life </strong>by converting a vector graphic to a collection of AnimatedVectorDrawable objects. It makes it easier for developers to use Motion Graphics in their apps.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Initially developed by Airbnb’s Android team, Lottie has been open-sourced so other Android devs can benefit from its ease of use.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In practice, you only need to add a single XML file into your project, then use Android Studio’s drag-and-drop functionality to add the animation clips right into your layout files.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Pros:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">It parses Adobe After Effects files. It can support .ae files and .svg files, making it easier to render animations made in a variety of programs.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Secondly, users don’t need to create a separate native module or library for each animation. The first hit loads all linked animations and stores them in memory until they’re needed.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It makes for easy updates later on down the line — if an animation is changed or needs updating for some reason, everything else remains untouched.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It comes with a ton of ready-made animations that you can quickly implement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cons:</strong></span></h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Code reusability of Lottie is low.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">It takes some time to kick-start a project using Lottie.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">Well, that was all about the top options you have while choosing an Android Library. If you want to build the best possible app, you need to carefully consider what you want out of your library before making your final decision.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">I feel this article will be incomplete if we don’t discuss how to lay your hands on the best ones.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3"><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Final Words</span></strong></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s easier than ever to create apps with the Android library system, but you still have to be careful when choosing one.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not all android libraries are created equal, and each one has its strengths and weaknesses that can affect your app. </span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>5 Top Countries For Offshore Mobile App Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several small to big businesses are outsourcing mobile app development to optimize their costs. Besides being a cost-effective solution, outsourcing is regarded as one of the topmost ways to draw a large pool of skilled and talented professionals for your mobile application development project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refer to the following list of the best countries for outsourcing application development:</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>1) India</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the rundown, it is one of the best countries to outsource app development. Moreover, India is the second-largest </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20500312" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">English-speaking country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the globe, making it an ideal alternative for software outsourcing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatively the country has a low literacy level, but the government pays attention to mathematical research and the advancement of technologies. India&#8217;s STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) graduates number is </span><b>2.6 million, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is quite enormous and is still increasing by the passing years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">India is one of the prime locations for software outsourcing as it grants affordable and even you can say the low cost of developers. Average</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile app developers in India charge between </span><b>$10 to $15/hr, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">making them less costly than mobile application development firms in the US that usually charge an average of $60/hr.</span><b> </b></p>

<h3><b>2) China</b><b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">China is one of the top-rated countries to outsource mobile app projects. Worldwide it is known for outsourcing, and moreover, it is one of the most expeditiously growing IT companies that produce around </span><b>4.7 million tech graduates </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">per year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in addition, few drawbacks are also there; first is in China, just </span><b>10 million of 1.3 billion Chinese residents</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are proficient at </span><b>speaking English</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So choosing China to outsource mobile app development, you may face a language barrier issue.       </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another major but dissolvable issue is China&#8217;s lax enforcement of intellectual property (IP) laws. However, this can be defeated by hiring a recognized outsourcing <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">mobile app development company</a> and building clear communication before beginning the work together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a western employer, then especially for you, it will be great to know that 30% of the Poland population speaks English, making communication more relaxed and easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, North American enterprises thinking to get connected with Poland&#8217;s mobile application development firm need to make accommodations for time zones if they want real-time solutions or directly want to get connected with the developers.</span></p>

<h3><b>5) Philippines</b></h3>
<p>More than <b>92% of the Philippines speak English</b>, making it one of the prime English-speaking countries worldwide. The country also has a specialized STEM high school system which ultimately increases the count of skilled developers. Moreover, this is the reason why the Philippines became one of the best countries to outsource software development.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, these improvements still haven’t closed the gap between developers in the Philippines and other countries on this list. This means other countries will remain better to outsource mobile app development. </span></p>
<h4><strong>Why choose the Philippines to outsource mobile app development projects?</strong></h4>

The recent decade has been dramatically transforming both businesses and consumers.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ionic framework is one of the famous and best front-end SDK and open-source mobile app development platforms that helps the industry form leading mobile applications for iOS, Windows, and Android smartphones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Do You Know?</b></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Let&#8217;s move further and know the benefits of using Ionic in cross-platform mobile application development…  </span></strong></p>
<h2><b>Why Enterprises Prefer Ionic Framework For Mobile App Development?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting from experienced Ionic app developers to normal businessmen, each of them nowadays favors employing Ionic SDK for agile and leading development of mobile applications. Moreover, you can also avail</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of</span> Ionic app development services<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make effective use of all features. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19194" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/affsa.png" alt="Ionic features" width="1024" height="555" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/affsa.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/affsa-300x163.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/affsa-768x416.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt;">Image Source: Agile Infoways</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here I have stated the few pointers which help you know why businesses should choose an Ionic framework for mobile application development.   </span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Open Source SDK</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To develop an excellent hybrid app, Ionic is one of the most appropriate choices for startups and SMEs as it is a 100% free, open-source framework authorized under MIT. It completely works differently and amazingly in the context of abrupt breakdown that other open-source SDK come across. With this open-source framework, you can perform things extraordinarily as it is steady, robust, and reliable. Ionic App Development is a savior if you are looking for agile app development. </span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Development Of Mobile Apps Across Platform</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Ionic, you can create hybrid mobile apps that can work over various mobile devices with different operating systems (OS). But while developing the mobile applications in Ionic, keep in mind that the app should be consistent with the different operating systems as this will only help you make use of this special feature of Ionic.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Single Code-base</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ionic allows you to form high-end user interfaces utilizing the same code to develop applications for different platforms. The programming languages that the <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-10-hybrid-apps-created-using-ionic-framework-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Ionic framework</a> applies are simply and quickly transformed from one operating system (OS) to another, which enables the app to be adopted across varying platforms.                        </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one chooses a native language instead of a hybrid, more efforts and money would be needed to learn selective languages for each platform. This can also shake the startup &amp; SME&#8217;s total mobile app development cost budget. </span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Default UI/UX</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good UI/UX design is the main component of each mobile application. Ionic includes wonderful animations with appealing themes and designs. This framework is considered one of the top-rated Front-end frameworks (UI interaction) containing various components such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript (JS), and beautiful designs. Moreover, this platform helps businesses in forming attractive and user-friendly applications.</span></p>
<h3><strong>5. Completely Based On AngularJS </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ionic-based mobile apps are powered up by AngularJS. By prolonging the HTML Syntax, AngularJS grants outstanding structure to help enterprises make codes more docile. In order to develop high-performing browser-based applications, the framework employs AngularJS. Moreover, AngularJS with Ionic helps you more by offering a bunch of functionalities.</span></p>
<h3><strong>6. App Integration </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ionic offers high-end application integration that enables the sharing of data and processes among various business apps. Moreover, it supports enterprises to organize their operations and correlate features with cloud apps. Most people encounter difficulty in the app integration part; if you are also facing the same, </span>hire ionic developers<span style="font-weight: 400;">. This will help you make the Ionic app development process smooth.</span></p>
<h3><strong>7. Easy Testing Of Apps</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing is one of the crucial phases as this helps you analyze the working process of the mobile application. With an Ionic framework, the testing process became very easy. Using this framework, one can test the application on a desktop and as well on a browser performing simulator testing employing Cordova commands for iOS and Android apps. Additionally, you can also test the apps by remote debugging.    </span></p>
<h3><strong>8. Utilization Of Cordova Plugins</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know what plugins are? It is a small piece of code, in JavaScript (JS) format, appended to your app that allows you to perform numerous tasks like a native app. Cordova plugins are available in the Ionic, which ultimately grants access to multiple operating system features (OS) such as pro-location, access to logs, camera, and more. These plugins intensify the complete performance of the mobile apps, and for doing so, you just need to add up a few simple codes to your development. </span></p>
<h3><strong>9. Robust CLI (Command-Line-Interface)</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comprehensive command-line interface is an in-built development server employed in the Ionic framework. It is a text-based interface where a user utilizes the command prompt to interact with the mobile application through the support of multiple commands.   </span></p>
<h3><strong>10. Useful Native Plugins</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ionic framework has complete access to native APIs &amp; Plugins that grant apps a native user experience. With Ionic, you can utilize around 120 native devices functionalities such as Bluetooth, Fingerprint AUTH,  and a lot with Cordova plugins. These plugins offe0r you access to multiple functionalities and help you enhance the overall performance of an app. </span></p>
<h3><strong>11. Scaled Up Technology</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ionic utilizes web-based technology, which mainly helps you doing app future updation. It means whenever you require to make modifications to your code or need to customize any adopted component that can be made simply without putting any effort.</span></p>
<h3><strong>12. Huge And Helpful Community</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not a simple task to work out with a new framework. Sometimes it&#8217;s become challenging even for experienced Ionic developers. Ionic is one of the most popular frameworks like Cordova and Angular; it has a big and active community. So working with Ionic can be simple as if you will be having any sort of query, then you resolve the same by taking the support of the community. </span></p>

<h2><strong>KeyPoints To Build An Amazing Mobile App</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For developing excellent mobile applications, you should first make a mobile app development module, and then after that, you should start working on it. The building process of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mobile-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">mobile app development</a> will include the following subjects.</span></p>
<h3><strong>1) Idea Analysis</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14034" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/akcelerator-ang.png" alt="" width="675" height="615" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/akcelerator-ang.png 1070w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/akcelerator-ang-300x273.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/akcelerator-ang-1024x932.png 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/akcelerator-ang-768x699.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the foremost thing that every business owner should consider before starting to build an app, especially when it comes to startups. An idea is something that affects the whole app since it is the base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An idea analysis for app development comprises market analysis, competition analysis, and country-specific research. It is a perfect startup business plan for your app idea.</span></p>
<p><strong>Market Analysis:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Right audience targeting, Unique Selling Proposition(USP), marketing channels are the key essentials of marketing analysis. Targeting the right customers is necessary because customers are the key ingredient for the success of your app. USP is needed to convince someone why your app is superior to other similar apps. Moreover, you can choose different marketing channels as per your target audience to make aware of people about your app.</span></p>
<p><strong>Competition analysis:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Google play store consists of millions of apps, which makes it more competitive and difficult for your app to get a good reputation in less time. Since there are already a number of similar apps, you just need to design and deploy unique features into your app to gain the attention of maximum users. Moreover, you need to choose a sensible monetization strategy to curb this problem.</span></p>
<p><strong>Country-specific research:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is important to research well to identify the needs of different countries and fulfill them via your app. Country-specific research helps <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-app-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">app developers</a> design the app as per the requirements of different people across the world. It will let them embed all those features required by different people into the startup&#8217;s mobile app.</span></p>

<h3>2) Planning</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14031" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ux-788002-1920_3.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="438" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ux-788002-1920_3.jpg 667w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ux-788002-1920_3-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good plan, if executed in the right manner, can take your app towards success soon. Your business plan must have a projected <a href="https://www.jotform.com/pdf-templates/profit-and-loss-statement-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">profit and loss statement</a> that establishes the various liabilities and assets that you will accumulate, ideally over a one-year period. Here are some key metrics are given below for the good planning of your startup mobile app.</span></p>
<p><strong>Surveys and Questionnaires:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> By running surveys and questionnaires, you will get unmatched insights about customer behavior that adds some weight to your mobile app business plan. If you know your target audience, it will become easy for you to ask questions about usage patterns.</span></p>
<p><strong>Monetization Strategy:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This strategy helps you to predict the cash flow of a mobile app. Most applications focus on user growth over revenue and monetize the user base much later.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check for Google trends:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Check Google Trends for keywords related to the idea of your application. Ideally, your application points to a problem and a growing market, and Google Trends can give you a fair idea about your potential customers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Use Analytics:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can also use third-party application analytics platforms such as App Annie and Sensor Tower to get more details about the size of the market and understand what you&#8217;re up against.</span></p>
<h3><b>3) Budgeting</b></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8091" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="429" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing.jpg 1200w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/budgetiing-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting with a mobile application for its new startup is very profitable compared to other companies. The mobile application can be built for a price as low as less than $ 2000, compared to a restaurant&#8217;s configuration that requires an investment of $ 50,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the significant budget metrics are given below:</span></p>
<p><strong>Lifetime Value:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This value gives you an idea of how much money you can expect to make on average from a single user. It actually indicates the financial viability of your mobile app.</span></p>
<p><strong>Customer Acquisition Cost:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is a critical metric that gives you an idea of the cost per app install or CPI. For an exact CPI, you need to use some industry benchmarks. Thus, it gives you an idea of how much you can expect to spend as you go after high-value users.</span></p>
<p><strong>Runway and Burn rate:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your burn rate should be low as it determines how much money you need to spend per month. At the same time, the runway is defined as the total funds per burn rate.</span></p>

<h3>4) Outsourcing</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-14030" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mobile-apps.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="378" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mobile-apps.jpg 950w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mobile-apps-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mobile-apps-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing projects is a good decision for any startup. For startups, it is difficult to invest in hiring in-house companies when they have a low budget. However, hiring a </span><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=mobile_8089&amp;utm_campaign=SME" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>dedicated mobile app developer</strong> </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would not cost much to startups and also provide the perfect mobile app development for their project as they focus on core activities. It is a cost-saving approach with many business benefits for startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire a developer</a>, then he/she will be solely responsible for building the mobile app. It will be their headache to provide you reliable solutions on the basis of the business requirements. Starting from choosing an app UI design to releasing it on Google Play Store or App Store, all will be done by the hired mobile app developer. But for that, you need to choose one of the<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/top-mobile-app-development-companies-that-innovate-unique-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> best Mobile App Development Companies</a> to hire an Android app developer or iOS app developer.</span></p>

<h3>5) Mobile App Marketing</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-8090" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="312" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing.jpg 1920w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing-600x281.jpg 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/app-marketing-1024x480.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are millions of users of mobile devices and tablets. There is a substantial market for the application. You must define your target audience to whom you will market your mobile application. The narrower the target segment, the higher the conversion rate. It will also help you provide excellent customer experience and greater customer loyalties. Moreover, you can use a wide range of channels to disseminate your marketing messages, depending on your user preferences. </span></p>
<p><b>Some of these channels include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media ads</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnerships</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retargeting campaigns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organic installs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">App store optimization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile site redirection</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content marketing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Event marketing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push and in-app notifications</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without marketing of an application, the mobile app will not become popular, so to introduce the mobile app in the market, you should take major concern. You can also take help from the social marketing team to make your app popular.</span></p>

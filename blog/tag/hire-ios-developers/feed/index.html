										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Are you embarking on your next iOS app project?</strong> </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discover the elite. </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unveiling the top iOS app development companies that redefine digital innovation. Choosing the right partner is paramount in the dynamic realm of mobile applications. These industry leaders are not just top web development companies but architects of exceptional user experiences crafting digital masterpieces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picture a seamlessly intuitive interface, cutting-edge functionalities, and a commitment to excellence. This isn&#8217;t just about code; it&#8217;s about transforming ideas into captivating digital realities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you&#8217;re a startup aiming for a breakthrough or an established brand craving a digital facelift, these powerhouses have covered you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why settle for the ordinary when you can have the extraordinary? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ValueCoders, your strategic ally in this journey, specializes in turning concepts into captivating iOS apps that resonate with your audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s transcend the ordinary, redefine digital engagement, and catapult your brand to the forefront of innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to elevate your digital game?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-stores/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple App Store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had 2.184 million apps and games in 2022, with non-gaming apps making up 78% of the store. The iOS App Store earned $25.5 billion in revenue, nearly double the Android app revenue of $14.2 billion. As of 2024, Android&#8217;s closest rival, Apple&#8217;s iOS, had a </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market share of 28.8 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, both the number of Android users, the number of Android apps, and the number of downloaded applications on the Google Play Store are far more than the iOS system. However, the iOS app is still much more profitable than the Android one.</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>Why? It’s due to a few simple reasons.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is less competition in the iOS marketplace, as publishers only accept high-quality apps for publishing on the App Store – they only publish apps that do! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, iOS users are more willing to spend a cent or two on their apps than Android users do not do often</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two primary reasons justify the significance of developing iOS apps on Android in terms of business profitability. Companies seek to hire expert iOS app developers to build apps that attract the growing number of iPhone users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are striving to create an excellent iOS app, you will need iOS developers with skills in this field. Where do you find the best iOS app developers?</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--p">Cross-platform app development is a massive trend in the software industry. More and more companies are looking to create applications that can run on multiple platforms without writing them from scratch. Several options are available for cross-platform app development, but Kotlin Multiplatform is quickly becoming the most popular one.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Kotlin Multiplatform is a toolkit that allows developers to write code that can run on multiple platforms. It supports all the major platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This blog post will discuss why Kotlin Multiplatform is the best option for cross-platform app development and how you can get started using it!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So let’s get started!</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Why Use it?</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are numerous benefits to using Kotlin for cross-platform app development; we listed some of them below:</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Native Interoperability</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">You can use any native library from any platform, as long as it’s available on the JVM. You can mix and match libraries from different platforms (e.g., Objective-C and Java) without overhead or cost.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, an Android developer can use a powerful iOS SDK like ARKit without understanding new programming languages or frameworks. Kotlin also makes it possible to work with JavaScript libraries like ReactJS and NodeJS by running code through a JavaScript engine, such as Nashorn.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Code Sharing</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Your team only needs to maintain one project that runs everywhere, and all developers can share their code across platforms. You have complete freedom over what you want to write in your code.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">All you need is Java 8, JavaScript, Swift 3, or Objective-C knowledge, which means less effort for understanding new syntaxes and language features when working with Kotlin.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">No UI Required</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">One significant difference between Kotlin and other multiplatform solutions is that you don’t need to create a user interface for each platform. Since most mobile applications require touch input, we must recreate the UI from scratch for each device.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, this problem goes away with Kotlin because you can create an app with no user interface! It’s much easier to deal with just one codebase than juggling multiple projects so that they can run on different devices.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Kotlin is Modern</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Developing apps for multiple platforms has never been more challenging. Language requirements and platform fragmentation make it necessary to know many programming languages and spend valuable time maintaining separate codebases.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">With Kotlin, you get the best of both worlds — you can use all the latest language features while still having access to older APIs and technologies. If you care about developing great apps quickly and easily, then Kotlin is the right choice for you!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Are you focusing on multiplatform app development? Hire dedicated kotlin app developers; by doing so, you will ‌develop a leading business-centric multiplatform within no time.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Kotlin Multiplatform Increasing Popularity</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25739 size-full" title="Kotlin Multiplatform" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kotlin-Multiplatform-scaled.jpg" alt="Kotlin Multiplatform" width="509" height="2560" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kotlin-Multiplatform-scaled.jpg 509w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kotlin-Multiplatform-407x2048.jpg 407w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">How Does It Work?</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The idea here was simple-if you can compile kotlin; it’s usable within Android environments, then why don’t we take advantage? The Jetbrains team behind this proposal started thinking about what might happen if their efforts were successful enough to bring such an accomplishment across both platforms: one being CVDoM (i Phone) &amp; another LM.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Jetbrains has been working on the possibility that Kotlin could also be compiled for iOS. This way, we would have 100% native code without wrappers or web pages; everything is integrated into the system, and there are no barriers when connecting with specific features of each platform.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-25736 size-full aligncenter" title="How does It work" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/How-does-It-work.jpg" alt="How does It work" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/How-does-It-work.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/How-does-It-work-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/How-does-It-work-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">What Does This Diagram Mean?</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">It means that Kotlin source code is assembled directly for each architecture. The Kotlin compiler utilizes LLVM to decode the Kotlin code into a native one, with just the instruction set required for the substantial architecture, for example, iOS x64 ARM.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This practice has an inconvenience that could be deemed a disadvantage: we will still have to create the UI layer twice.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Although it may be considered a disadvantage because of the extra cost, in some circumstances, it could be a benefit, as you can create a slightly distinct UI for each platform giving the user an experience near to the typical usage of each platform. As we will see in the “What is coming next” section, there is a new alternative to develop the UI (Jetpack Compose) that could alleviate this inconvenience.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-25737 size-full" title="What Does This Diagram Mean" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/What-Does-This-Diagram-Mean.jpg" alt="What Does This Diagram Mean" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/What-Does-This-Diagram-Mean.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/What-Does-This-Diagram-Mean-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/What-Does-This-Diagram-Mean-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">We can use this approach to develop the common parts of our libraries or modules. In Android’s case, generate an aar/jar file ‌you can include in your project. If it applies to iOS, too, there is no need to worry about managing <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">frameworks</strong> because they will be made available through <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Swift Package Manager </strong>or <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cocoapods</strong>.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-25738 size-full" title="My Module" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/My-Module.jpg" alt="My Module" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/My-Module.jpg 800w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/My-Module-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/My-Module-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">With this approach, the compiler will forge the library with only the associated code, which means that in the case of iOS, the .framework will contain the shared code and the platform-specific code (iOS code written in Kotlin).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The native UI layer will use libraries or module sayer being a native library. There is no restriction on how to use them, so they could operate them from a plugin for Flutter, a connector for Xamarin, React Native, or even link it with a Cordova web plugin. Although technically possible, there is not much business benefit to using such combinations.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Kotlin Multiplatform: Why It Is Better Than Other Cross-Platform Tool</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">In the past few years, there has been a shift in the mobile app development landscape. With the rise of cross-platform app development tools, developers are no longer limited to developing for a single platform.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Kotlin Multiplatform is one of the most popular cross-platform app development tools. Here are seven reasons why it’s better than other cross-platform tools:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">* It’s simpler and more intuitive than Java or C++, which means we spend less time learning the basics. And because it integrates with JavaScript frameworks like React Native and AngularJS2, you don’t have to learn JavaScript if you don’t want to!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">* It doesn’t require codebase modifications when making apps on different platforms, so maintenance costs are lower and deployment times are shorter.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">When using Kotlin Multiplatform, you can share data between Android and iOS apps without using third-party plugins or libraries!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">* You can use your favorite IDE, like Android Studio or Xcode, with it and all your favorite libraries without having to change anything about your workflow!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">* Kotlin Multiplatform makes creating multiplatform apps for the three major operating systems easy, making your potential customer base more extensive.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">* Although some exceptions exist, programming languages usually run at comparable speeds. However, Kotlin Multiplatform requires much less effort to achieve native performance because it compiles machine code instead of an intermediate language.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">* Even though it was developed by JetBrains — the company behind IntelliJ IDEA — Kotlin Multiplatform is entirely open-source under Apache 2 license, so you don’t need to worry about proprietary permits and licensing fees!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">* One last thing that sets Kotlin Multiplatform apart from other cross-platform solutions is that it does not rely on browser rendering engines (although this might be a downside for some).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Instead, this tool creates software applications that act and feel like native apps running directly on the device with full access to sensors and hardware features.</p>

<h2 class="graf graf--p" style="text-align: center;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why prefer Kotlin for android app development?</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are a few reasons ‌Kotlin is gaining popularity among Android app developers.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">First, Kotlin is statically typed, which catches errors and potential bugs in your code as you write it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Second, Kotlin is interoperable with Java. You can use Java libraries in your Kotlin code and vice versa. If you’re already familiar with Java, learning Kotlin will be a breeze.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Finally, the Android development community has firmly embraced Kotlin. You’ll find plenty of online resources, tutorials, and support forums to help you get started with Kotlin programming.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What are the main features of Kotlin Multiplatform?</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Kotlin Multiplatform is a relatively new feature that was introduced in Kotlin 1.3. It allows you to share code between platforms (such as Android and iOS) without having to write it twice.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of an MVP in Software Development is to validate a product idea quickly and cheaply without incurring the cost and risk of developing a full-fledged product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By starting with a small, imperfect product, businesses can gather feedback from early adopters and iterate rapidly to create a final product that better meets the market&#8217;s needs. While MVPs have become popular in the software industry, they can be applied to any type of product development.</span></p>

<h2><b>Role Of MVP Development Services In Software Projects </b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26147 " title="Role of MVP in Software Development" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Role-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png" alt="Role of MVP in Software Development" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Role-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Role-of-MVP-in-Software-Development-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching a new software development project is always risky. There&#8217;s no guarantee that the finished product will be well-received by users or even work as intended. MVPs are often used to test new ideas and gather feedback from users, helping to reduce the risk of launching a full-scale development project. </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, an MVP can be built relatively quickly and cheaply, making it an appealing option for startups and small businesses. Building an MVP also has the benefit of helping to focus the development team on the essential features of the product. By starting with an MVP, you can avoid wasting time and money on features that may never be used.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ultimately, whether or not to build an MVP is a decision that depends on the risks and rewards of your particular project. But in many cases, an MVP can help to reduce the risks of launching a new software development project.</span></p>

<h3>Determine The Direction of Design</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an MVP helps you validate the concept and get a fresh perspective regarding the features and interface elements that users may expect from a similar product. The data collected becomes handy in developing and designing the software to fulfill the audience&#8217;s expectations. </span></p>
<h3>Improvised Functionality</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP development services ensure the system&#8217;s proper functioning aligns with the business vision. Getting custom features in a product requires a skilled and resourceful team for better functioning. It is better to catch the bugs or any other deficiency in the development stage to avoid delays after the final release.</span></p>
<h3>Develop a Unique Set of Features for The Product</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An innovative MVP in Software development aims to solve recurring problems with understandable working principles. It enables you to make an easy-to-use product. The users get a faster and more efficient solution to their problem, and the development teams get their desired outcomes.</span></p>

<h3>Precise Project Planning</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working on a minimum viable project imbibes the full concept of software. It decides on features and technology stack selection. MVP often works as a reference point while working on a product.   </span></p>
<h2><b>Benefits Of An MVP In Software Development</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It aims to get the product out to the market quickly, so it can begin generating feedback from real users. First, it allows for more rapid iteration and experimentation. Since only the essential features are included in the MVP, there is less code to write and test. This makes it easier to make changes and try out new ideas. Second, an MVP can help to reduce development costs. By starting with a smaller scope, it is possible to cut down on costly features that may never be used. Finally, an MVP  can help you get your product to market faster. By focusing on the core functionality, you can get your product in front of users sooner and begin gathering critical feedback.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26150 " title="Benefits of MVP in Software Development" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Benefits-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png" alt="Benefits of MVP in Software Development" width="541" height="406" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Benefits-of-MVP-in-Software-Development.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Benefits-of-MVP-in-Software-Development-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></p>
<h3><b>Present A Better Picture To Stakeholders and Investors</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups include minimum viable products in their pitch deck. An MVP in software development gives investors and stakeholders a risk-free decision-making process. It helps increase your brand awareness and attract skilled talent with an improved vision and upgraded idea of your functional product.</span></p>
<h3>Better Cost-Efficiency of The Project</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP gives a better outlook of the necessary features required for the product&#8217;s success. It helps avoid unpopular methods among the beta testers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP helps the teams avoid building excess complex solutions. The development and maintenance costs witness an exponential reduction and a better understanding of the required talent before hiring extensive departments.</span></p>
<h3>Retain Focus on The End Goal</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP reduces uncertainty and deters the team from procrastination. It helps shorten the feedback loop and enhances the overall development speed. </span></p>

<h3>Less Room for Error</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project gets more complex with the increased involvement of people and systems. The development process becomes harder to control. Newcomers in software development get used to the system. It avoids complexity and reduces potential errors. <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/mvp-app-development-company?utm_source=Web+Blog&amp;utm_medium=GB&amp;utm_id=ValueCoders" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">MVP development services</a> help reduce system shutdowns and facilitate maintenance management.  </span></p>
<h3>Better Relations with Prospective Customers</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MVP prepares the viable groundwork for product development. The development teams create a solution for the audience as the marketing team builds connections and spreads the word around the web. It enables you to attract daily active users to your future product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While an MVP in software development has many benefits, it is important to remember that it also has some risks. First, since an MVP is usually released with few features, it may not be able to meet all of the customer’s needs. This could lead to early user attrition. Second, an MVP may generate negative feedback if it is not well-received by the market. It is important to have a plan for how you will address this feedback before releasing your MVP. Overall, an MVP can be a great way to develop and release your software product rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being productive is key to success in any field, but it can be difficult to maintain a high level of productivity day after day. That&#8217;s where the MVP system comes in. MVP stands for &#8220;minimum viable product.&#8221; The idea is to create the simplest possible version of your product or service that still meets your customers&#8217; needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It enables you to avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary details and to stay focused on what&#8217;s most important. Additionally, MVP development services help you get customer feedback more quickly and make better use of your limited resources. Keeping your product or service as simple as possible keeps you focused on what&#8217;s most important and gets it done quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<h2>Successful Businesses that Started With MVP Development</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-26151 size-full" title="Famous Companies that Started with MVP Development" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Famous-Companies-that-Started-with-MVP-Development.png" alt="Famous Companies that Started with MVP Development" width="512" height="384" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Famous-Companies-that-Started-with-MVP-Development.png 512w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Famous-Companies-that-Started-with-MVP-Development-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are no guarantees in the business world, developing a minimum viable product (MVP) can increase your chances of success. MVPs allow entrepreneurs to test their assumptions about a product or service before investing significant time and resources. If the MVP is well-received, it can provide valuable feedback that can be used to fine-tune the final product. Launching an MVP can generate buzz and create interest in a business before it is fully up and running. It helps attract potential customers and investors. Many notable companies have started with MVP development, including big names like Dropbox, Airbnb, and Tinder.</span></p>
<h3>Meta (Formerly Facebook)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started with the name &#8220;The Facebook.&#8221; As an MVP product, it helped American students stay connected with friends from other schools. Initially, it became operational in four universities. Access was granted to everyone without any geographical barrier after it was successfully tested for a year.</span></p>
<h3>Dropbox</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox is a known file-hosting company. It implemented the MVP approach in the form of an explanatory video that demonstrated the possibilities and innovative functions of the technology. Surprisingly, signups increased 5 times in just one night without an actual product.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it has over 600 million users. By testing the business hypothesis and learning the actual market needs, Dropbox used the MVP strategy without releasing the actual software.</span></p>
<h3>Groupon</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original idea was changed/modified with time to meet the market needs. As an MVP product, it gathered people with the intent of helping each other and running a crowdfunding campaign or boycotting some negligent stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original idea was modified to gather people for a crowdfunding campaign and boycotting negligent stores. Users started promoting its special coupons and promo codes. Manual emails were sent to individual customers for effective resolution of the requests. It helped save costs on software development and get better results from testing the product viability that later served global customers.</span></p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started as an SMS communication platform among Odeo, a podcasting platform, and employees. The MVP product provided only an SMS-sending facility without hashtags, replies, reposts, etc. Later, it developed into the modern world of Twitter with all its accustomed features.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Now, when you have decided to go for mobile app development, then there are some decisions that you might need to take in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">One of the most important decisions which you might need to take is selecting the right operating system to launch your mobile apps. </span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Undoubtedly, your goal might be to launch on both platforms, but for now, it is very risky and expensive to develop an app for both <em>Android and iOS</em> simultaneously. And you need to hire iOS developers or hire android developers for custom application development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">By choosing the operating system, we mean deciding between the <strong>Google play store</strong> or the<strong> Apple app store</strong> to launch your mobile app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif;"><b>Note: Some Interesting facts</b></span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif;"><b>Market share </b></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Android has the highest global market share across the globe as compared to iOS. Android has successfully maintained its position as the leading operating system globally, controlling the mobile operating system market with a <strong>73.0%</strong> share. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">According to the Google report, Apple iOS and Android jointly control nearly<strong> 99.0%</strong> of the global market share. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">According to a Statista report, in 2019, smartphones built on android OS held an<strong> 87.0%</strong> share in the global market, and it is expected to increase in the coming years. In the same year, iOS devices had a <strong>13.0%</strong> market share. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Here is the graph representing mobile operating systems market share across the globe from 2009 to 2016- </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif; color: #ff6600;"><b>Winner- Android</b></span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">For android app development, you are required to <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-android-developers?utm_source=iosvsandroid-17542&amp;utm_medium=Amyra-rg121&amp;utm_campaign=Wblog" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire android app developers!</a></span></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif;"><b>Development cost</b></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">When selecting between iOS vs. Android mobile app development, you must consider the estimated app prices for android app development. As you know, Android OS empowers various devices with different screen sizes, which ultimately surges the development time along with the cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">On the other side, iOS has a restricted amount of devices, which results in a high speed of the development process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Furthermore, iOS vs. Android development cost is also based on app complexity and the number of features. So, while comparing Android and iOS for mobile app development, consider that both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store have their publishing apps cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">For instance- for Android apps, you need to pay a one-time registration fee of <strong>$25</strong>, and for the Apple app store, you need to pay <strong>$99 per year.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif; color: #ff6600;"><b>Winner- Android </b></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif;"><b>App Updates &amp; Testing </b></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Android OS and iOS have their personal simulators for app testing. Now coming to the iOS vs. Android app testing difference than TestFlight, an iOS testing environment is much faster than an android emulator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">However, the android emulator virtual machine is much more effective and has a realistic representation than iOS. Now, coming to the app updates feature, both operating systems release new OS updates every year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Where an iOS app takes up to two weeks for a new release or updates, an android takes several hours to publish the new app release.  </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif;"><b>Revenue Models </b></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">This is one of the most important factors which you must consider while deciding the OS platform for launching your app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">If we compare iOS vs. Android based on the revenue model, then Android has a higher percentage of ad-supported applications than iOS. iOS mobile app development platform mainly depends on purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Even when iOS pimples you to pay for apps, they still gain more attention and revenue with that model. According to a study conducted in 2017, iOS earns <strong>70.0%</strong> more revenue than android app development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Below is the diagram of the revenue model of iOS vs. Android showing <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/google-cloud-vs-azure-which-platform-is-best-to-pick/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow">which platform</a> has earned the maximum amount of revenue in the past few years.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif;"><b>Customization</b></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">For iPhone users, iOS 14  was a revolution that supported various widgets on the iOS home screen. While in the beginning, this seems more fun, and a lot of users have taken advantage of widget-customizing apps to transform their devices&#8217; look. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">However, it still didn’t match the level and capability of customization in Android apps, which smoothly allows for third-party launchers that can entirely change your phone into something exclusive or new.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">If you want a smartphone that truly offers a personalized, customized, and tinkering experience for your home screen, then Android app development is the right platform for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Customization has always been a strength of <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/list-of-top-android-app-development-companies-best-android-application-service-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Android app development companies</a>. Android apps are highly customizable, and one can easily install and set them up on their home screen or add them as widgets and shortcuts. </span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Even if Apple owns all the software &amp; hardware, and there are fewer iOS devices than Android devices. Still, iOS devices are becoming a little less standardized than they have been in the past few years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Furthermore, since the launch of the <strong>iPhone X series</strong>, the majority of developers have more screen size &amp; UI constraints to work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While building an app for the iOS platform can sometimes be quicker, it can also be longer for the App Store to allow permission for your product with the strict guidelines &amp; regulations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">On the contrary, android apps usually take a day or two to get approval, after which updates can be released within a matter of hours. </span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif;"><b>App Publishing</b></span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Publishing any app in the Play store is quite simple, affordable, easy, and efficient. It usually takes a few hours to go live after the initial approval process. Updating or releasing android updates is very easy and needs no validation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">Apple store, however, will test your application for every possible issue, bugs, and offer validation to publish it on the platform. It is a time-consuming &amp; long process and costs more than what you need to pay for publishing on the Play store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: roboto, sans-serif;">In conclusion, both Android OS and iOS are quite popular and <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/build-amazing-mobile-app-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">amazing mobile</a> app development platforms.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">In our last blog, we considered Swift Programming Language as one of the most popular mobile app development trends that are going to conquer in 2019.  And that&#8217;s quite a fact! Swift has already taken over Objective-C slowly and smoothly in December 2016. Before going into a detailed conversation about Objective-C vs Swift check out the winning number:</p>
<figure id="attachment_5873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5873" style="width: 481px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Swift-Going-Over-Objective-C.png" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-5873 " src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Swift-Going-Over-Objective-C.png" alt="Swift Going Over Objective C" width="481" height="407" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5873" class="wp-caption-text">Swift Going Over Objective C In Dec&#8217;16</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, many have missed that the trend is going somewhere else. Some <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/7-top-notch-cross-platform-app-development-companies-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">top-notch</a> giants like IBM, LinkedIn, Facebook, Uber, Mozilla were already involved with <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/11-tips-successful-mobile-app-development-businesses-android-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">app development</a> with swift. But now, worldwide startups (Including the fast-growing ones in silicon valley) are focusing on Swift too. <a href="https://www.upwork.com/press/2017/01/26/upwork-reveals-fastest-growing-skills-q4-natural-language-processing-tech-skills-top-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">A study from UpWork </a>shows app development in swift is one of the top fastest growing skills for startups and freelancers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before we discuss Objective C vs Swift, here&#8217;s some crisp information about Swift&#8217;s background:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Background of Swift Programming Language</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Swift is a programming language from Apple that&#8217;s characterized as “Objective-C without the C”. It was introduced at WWDC in 2014 and announced open source in 2015. After it went open-source, IBM and Apple jointly started investing in it. App development with swift is supported for iOS, OSX, watchOS, tvOS, and last but not least Linux. It has got five major version releases to date. Swift 2.0 in September 2015, Swift 3.0 in September 2016, Swift 4 in 2017 and the latest Swift 5 launched in March 2019. Now it is one of the top trending techs on Stack Overflow crossing Objective C.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Trending-techs-on-stack-overflow-Swift-vs-Objective-C.png" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5874 size-full" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Trending-techs-on-stack-overflow-Swift-vs-Objective-C.png" alt="Trending techs on stack overflow Objective C vs Swift" width="690" height="444" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Trending-techs-on-stack-overflow-Swift-vs-Objective-C.png 690w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Trending-techs-on-stack-overflow-Swift-vs-Objective-C-600x386.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">7 Reasons For Startups To Adopt Swift Over Objective C</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Swift has taken off successfully not only because it’s well structured &amp; designed, but also people have supported it. Moreover, independently managed conferences such as the Swift Summit help to enrich their community. Let&#8217;s discuss on Objective C vs Swift to see what&#8217;s there for startups to adopt this language.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"> 1) Open source &amp; Growing fast</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An open-source programming language makes it immediately accessible as well as less costly for startup companies. According to studies, open source software/languages collectively help business owners save around $60 billion per year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Swift, being a programming language is available on both Linux and Windows. With the support of the open-source community, Swift shows great potential and it&#8217;s growing really fast. From 1980 to 2014, it was a monopoly for Objective-C to develop native iOS apps, however, the Swift programming language has brought an end to that era. Here&#8217;s a glimpse of the growth:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-9893" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screenshot-from-2019-05-28-10-51-54.png" alt="Growth of Swift Programming language" width="778" height="340" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screenshot-from-2019-05-28-10-51-54.png 890w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screenshot-from-2019-05-28-10-51-54-600x262.png 600w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screenshot-from-2019-05-28-10-51-54-300x131.png 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screenshot-from-2019-05-28-10-51-54-768x336.png 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screenshot-from-2019-05-28-10-51-54-640x280.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2) Less time to market &amp; Easy coding</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the biggest challenges for startups is shortening time to market. They need quality products in less time. The Swift programming language can help you with that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With Swift package managers, developers can push their packages to collaborate with others, focus on the logic and utilize different packages to quickly assemble apps in order to reduce time to market. There are also different repositories of Swift package managers like IBM Swift Package Catalog, which offer high-quality dependency management and easy coding options for Swift application development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IBM-Swift.png" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5875" style="margin-bottom: 25px;" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IBM-Swift.png" alt="IBM Swift" width="1193" height="549" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IBM-Swift.png 1938w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IBM-Swift-600x276.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1193px) 100vw, 1193px" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3) Fewer codes and Least error prone</h2>
<p>Swift as a functional programming language supports passing functions as variables. As a result, you produce highly generic code that can do a lot of amazing things hence, reducing repetition as well as efforts for app development with swift.</p>
<p>On the other hand, on behalf of Swift&#8217;s predictable behavior when a nil optional variable is used, Swift instantaneously triggers a run-time crash. The crash fuels up the bug-fixing process due to its consistent behavior. Swift forces you to fix the issue right away. This in return, reduces development time for application development with swift.</p>
<h2>4) Safer and Easy to maintain <span style="color: #ffffff;">Objective C vs Swift</span></h2>
<p>Safety is a crucial aspect when it comes to mobile applications. In this competitive marketplace, a startup should concentrate on developing a secure app. Moreover, if the app is easy to maintain then it&#8217;s a boon indeed.</p>
<p>Swift programming language offers both the benefits at a time. Be it the way it handles bugs or calls the pointer variables, it produces safer apps than Objective C. On the other hand, Swift app development is much easier to maintain as it does not have any legacy. Objective C cannot evolve until C evolves, however, Swift does not have such dependencies which makes it easier to maintain.</p>
<h2>5) Less costly to hire Swift developers than Objective C</h2>
<p>If you want to <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-ios-developers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=hire-iOS-developers-5860&amp;utm_campaign=startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">hire iOS developers</a> to develop Native apps, Objective C and Swift programming language are the only choices. As per a survey from Stack Overflow, the Objective to <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-c-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>hire C developers</strong></a> are the highest paid ones followed by Swift developers. Here&#8217;s is the list:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Developer-Salay-Swift-vs-Objective-C.png" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_blank" rel="follow"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5877" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Developer-Salay-Swift-vs-Objective-C.png" alt="Developer Salay Swift vs Objective C" width="704" height="567" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Developer-Salay-Swift-vs-Objective-C.png 637w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Developer-Salay-Swift-vs-Objective-C-600x483.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /></a>Hence, in order to reduce development cost, Swift programming language is much more preferable than Objective C.</p>
<h2> 6) Swift has a bright future</h2>
<p>Swift is a very organized &amp; well-designed programming language from Apple. It is faster than Objective C, offers unified memory management, it&#8217;s intuitive, clean and expressive which allows you to express the intent of the code without the language getting in the way. This is for certain that this language is not going anywhere in the near future at all.</p>

<hr />
<h2>7) Developers love it!!</h2>
<p>One of the most important factors for the success of any programming language is the developers. Developers focus on and embrace the modern technologies in order to make the development environment fun and engaging  to retain top talent. According to a 2016 study in Stack Overflow, Swift is one of the most-loved language, receiving votes from 72.1 % of developers. Also, swift has a large developer community which makes it more supportive and interesting for startup app development.</p>

<h2>The bottom line of Objective C vs Swift</h2>
<p>In the competitive business environment where time is a deciding factor for startups, it is a major decision to take whether they want to switch to a new programming language or not. However, if you/ your iOS developers are already using Objective C, then you have a head-start and don&#8217;t need to learn an entirely different language as the learning curve towards swift app development will be easy.</p>
<p>Moreover, your efforts are justified as <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">application development</a> with swift is advanced, open-source, faster,  more secure and developer friendly. Hence, it&#8217;s time to adopt the change.

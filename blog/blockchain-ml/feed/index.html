<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s have some of the best practices for AI implementation in business.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong> Define Clear Business Objectives</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before implementing AI, businesses need to define clear objectives and identify areas where AI can deliver the most value. This may involve conducting a thorough analysis of business processes and identifying pain points and areas for improvement.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><b> Start Small and Scale Up</b></h3>
</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud Computing and Blockchain are two revolutionary technologies to help your business keep up with the times and increase your revenue. But how do you decide which of these two technologies is right for your business? Do you need them both? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what you should know about the differences between Blockchain Technology and Cloud Computing so that you can make an informed decision about how to proceed with implementing these game-changing technologies into your company’s operations.</span></p>
<h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing is a way of storing and accessing your information online. You don&#8217;t need to buy or maintain a server to store data because it&#8217;s all stored in the cloud. You can access the data from anywhere as long as you have an internet connection, making it easier to work remotely. With cloud computing, you don&#8217;t have to worry about backing up files because it automatically backs up everything and is available whenever you need it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing services come in two basic categories. The first type is known as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), which provides virtualized resources like servers, storage space, and network capacity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other type is Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which provides development tools, programming languages, and operating systems that developers use when creating applications. A common choice among AI Development Company founders looking to get started with AI is PaaS providers like Amazon Web Services that offer AI tools like TensorFlow.</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-27075 aligncenter" title="Advantages of Cloud Computing" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Advantages-of-Cloud-Computing-1-1024x614.jpg" alt="Advantages of Cloud Computing" width="811" height="486" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Advantages-of-Cloud-Computing-1-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Advantages-of-Cloud-Computing-1-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Advantages-of-Cloud-Computing-1-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Advantages-of-Cloud-Computing-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Disadvantages Of Cloud Computing</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although C</span>loud Computing<span style="font-weight: 400;"> has many advantages, there are also a few disadvantages you should know. Some disadvantages include</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> Centralized Data Storage </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Cloud computing stores all your data in one central location, making it vulnerable to being hacked or tampered with.</span></li>
<li><b>Physical Hardware Failure</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; With physical hardware failures such as power outages or server crashes, you can lose access to your data, resulting in high business downtime and an interruption in productivity.</span></li>
<li><b>Lack of Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Cloud computing systems are more vulnerable to attack due to their centralized nature.</span></li>
<li><b>Cost-Efficiency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; When it comes to cost-efficiency, cloud computing is typically much more expensive than implementing a blockchain solution at the enterprise level.</span></li>
<li><strong>Single Point of Failure</strong> &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to cloud computing being centralized and in one location, your business would be affected worldwide if there were an outage.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Real-World Applications For Cloud Services</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing is a popular option because it allows storing data anywhere and in any format. In contrast, blockchain technology only stores data in one location. This means that if there were a virus or natural disaster near your office, all of your important files would not be lost. Here are five real-world cloud service applications:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Dropbox</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">: With over 300 million users, Dropbox has revolutionized the way we store information on the internet. It provides an easy way to access your documents from any device without losing any formatting when sharing with others. It also offers automatic backup as soon as you save a file so that even if your computer crashes, everything will still be saved and accessible.</span></span></li>
<li><b>Google Apps</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Another useful cloud storage application is Google apps. It gives you 15 gigabytes of free storage, which can be upgraded ‌by paying monthly fees ranging from $1-$10 per month, depending on the size. You can easily organize files into folders and sub-folders by color coding them with Google Drive&#8217;s labeling system, making it easier to find what you&#8217;re looking for.</span></span></li>
<li><b> SlideRocket: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SlideRocket is another excellent app for small business presentations. You can upload your PowerPoint presentation, edit it online and then download the finished product without ever having to use PowerPoint again! Best of all, they offer several pricing packages to fit your needs &#8211; starting at just $3/month.</span></span></li>
<li><strong> I</strong><b>BM Cloud:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IBM&#8217;s cloud services offer several great options to meet different businesses&#8217; needs. For example, IBM Bluemix combines Watson&#8217;s artificial intelligence with infrastructure as a service (IaaS), while IBM SoftLayer delivers bare metal servers, virtual machines, and virtual desktops on demand. Their website has many more unique offerings, so ‌look around and see what works best for you!</span></span></li>
<li><b>Big Data Analysis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Next real-time case is Airbnb. Airbnb&#8217;s mission statement is to create a world where people can belong anywhere. They want everyone to experience new cultures and places, no matter their budget. They accomplish this by renting out rooms and houses instead of hotels, allowing guests to interact with locals and learn about the culture of their destination while spending less money than they would otherwise.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Prospects For Corporate Cloud Computing </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, the platform as a service (PaaS) market is estimated to be worth approximately 136 billion U.S. dollars. PaaS  is a type of cloud computing offered by service providers to customers. PaaS is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud. </span></p>

<h2><strong>What Is Blockchain Technology?</strong></h2>
<p>Blockchain Technology,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> also known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), is a newer way of storing and sharing data. The data stored on a blockchain consists of blocks containing a timestamp and other information. It’s not just one central database that stores all the information, so there’s no single point of failure. This makes the blockchain extremely secure and difficult to hack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technology can eliminate the need for middlemen in many transactions. If a buyer and seller don’t trust each other, they can send money to an escrow account at their respective banks. With blockchain, you can transfer money directly without going through an intermediary like PayPal or Venmo. To explore business possibilities, enterprises often hire <strong><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blockchain-development-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Blockchain Development Company</a></strong> to have a better understanding. </span></p>

<hr />
<h2><strong>Disadvantages Of Blockchain Technology </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Lack of enough users:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If there are not enough people using the system, then the value of the token decreases. The result would be that blockchain technology becomes less appealing to businesses.</span></li>
<li><b>Complex technology:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The processing power required for running blockchains at scale is more than a typical server can handle. The blockchain ledger has to be replicated on every node, which increases that workload.</span></li>
<li><b>Time-consuming tech: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchains work slowly. Bitcoin, a public blockchain platform popular in its own right, takes an average of 10 minutes to record each transaction on its network. Because blockchains are decentralized, any one person or group of people can not alter them.</span></li>
<li><b>Low user base:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Low user adoption will affect a platform&#8217;s trust and safety. For example, if users feel that another company can use data provided to one company, they might not be inclined to provide it. Similarly, they won&#8217;t use any platform if they are concerned that their information isn’t secure.</span></li>
<li><b>Lack of interoperability. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This connects to a low user base because for blockchain platforms to be interoperable, users need to be on many different platforms.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Real-World Uses Of Blockchain</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a globally operating AI Development Company; we&#8217;ve noticed the rise in using blockchain technology and its impacts on various industries. This allows businesses to explore and see if it&#8217;s right for them. There are many ways that blockchain technology has improved or changed certain aspects of life and work in various industries, such as banking, healthcare, supply chain management, energy, education, retail, and more. Here are five real-world blockchain applications that are in trend:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Health Care: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain in health care is a multi-billion dollar industry, and every major organization has a relationship with it. From hospitals to insurance companies, doctors, patients, and patients&#8217; relatives, almost everyone involved with the healthcare system  uses blockchain technology. This technology provides cost-effective solutions for all parties involved in healthcare, including patients. Its transparency means multiple stakeholders can easily access and review their data in real-time via their mobile devices.</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></span></li>
<li><b>Supply Chain Management:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> More than $1 trillion worth of goods passes through customs clearance annually. A complex network connecting shippers, carriers, and forwarders is needed to complete these transactions from end to end. It can be hard for any entity within this network to maintain an accurate product information record because different players have separate records on disparate systems without reconciling any inconsistencies between them.</span></span></span></li>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Blockchain technology will make renewable power sources more efficient by allowing communities to trade green power peer-to-peer without an intermediary utility. Individuals can produce excess electricity and sell it back into the grid when they need extra money, providing sustainable electricity prices and driving down costs.<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, people will be able to generate their own solar power at home, then share that solar power directly with nearby consumers without being subject to local restrictions on trading residential solar power in other places.</span></span></li>
<li><b>Retail:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With Walmart’s partnership with IBM Food Trust, customers are gaining insight into where their food came from and how fresh it is. The trust gives customers access to data like farm origination details, transportation conditions, storage temperature levels, and spoilage. Transparency is key when shopping for food.</span></span></span></li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools can leverage blockchain technology for certificates of achievement to ensure that student diplomas cannot be faked or duplicated. Teachers can also use blockchain to verify school transcripts or transfer credits across schools. This technology can help schools improve efficiency and reduce fraud while maintaining rigorous standards.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he bad news is that fraudulent activities are rising. The good news is that <strong>ML(Machine Learning)</strong> is there to safeguard &#8211;your hard-earned assets. “</span><b>As quoted by BBC Fraud Solution expert  Aslam Mohammed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To decode this further, we’ve got to understand Machine Learning first.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Machine Learning is a popular technology trend that helps in the <strong>Global Fraud Landscape</strong>—citing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the threats of the growing complexity of the payment ecosystem. Fraudsters primarily attack the “path of least resistance,” which rather intensifies the need for Machine Learning.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning uses <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> to run software applications in the prediction of outcomes without programming needs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning comes with versatile features &#8211; i.e., email spam detection, image recognition, and product recommendations, e.g., e-commerce sites, Business Process Automation(BPA), and predictive maintenance.</span></p>
<h2><b>Types of Machine Learning:</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning is all about how an algorithm learns to become accurate in predictions. We can divide Machine Learning into four categories:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supervised Learning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsupervised Learning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semi-supervised Learning</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinforcement Learning </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Classical machine facilitates learning to become more accurate in its predictions.</span></p>
<h4><strong>The type of algorithm a data scientist chooses  depends on which purpose &amp; data we want to choose</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Supervised learning-</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Since the whole procedure is supervised in this type of machine learning supply algorithms with labeled training to assess correlations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data scientists supply algorithms with labeled training data in this sort of machine learning and define the variables.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Unsupervised learning- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of machine learning involves algorithms trained on unlabeled data. These algorithms scan through datasets seeking meaningful connections. Both the data algorithms train on, and the predictions or recommendations output is pre-managed.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Semi-supervised learning- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sort of approach helps machine learning involve a mix of the two preceding types. Data scientists may feed an algorithm mostly labeled training data, but the model is free to explore the data independently and develop its understanding of the data set.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Reinforcement learning.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A very much popular to complete a multi-step process to define rules clearly. Popularly known as wait and watch technique.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data scientists program an algorithm to complete a task and impart&#8212;positive or negative cues depending on the output. Whereas algorithms decide on their steps are to be taken.</span></p>

<h4>Give A Glance Over- <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/machine-learning-app-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal">MACHINE LEARNING APP IDEAS</a></h4>
<hr />
<p><b>A brief description is of how machine learning works: But we are on this page to discuss ML in fraud detection.</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">World-cross Cyber Security has been the Talk of the Town for some years. Especially in e-commerce, the cases of cyber threats are haunting the proliferation of online business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Despite all security mechanisms, the fraudsters can breakthrough and siphon-off. In microseconds. </b></p>
<p><b>So What is the remedy-the cure? Machine Learning has answers for it. </b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Even during the phase of COVID-19, fraudsters kept on with malicious intentions and victimized innocent subscribers in the name of donations. PHISHING was at a peak. So, I believe this will help global companies to beef up the payment gateway using the security mechanisms of ML( Machine Learning).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>LET’S KNOW WHY ML features suit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> best for </span><b>Fraud Detection </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>
<h4>Super Fast</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speed of your action plan matters if you want to clamp down on fraudsters. If you are sluggish in your approach, then in a fraction of a second, the fraudsters may barge in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you switch on a bulb, you don’t have to wait. It lit up at once.ML is for you as it runs several real-time analysis with thousands of queries while comparing the outcome to the best results. It hardly takes milliseconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It always remains in the process of queries to find the best results. It helps analyze customer’s behavior so as when an anomaly arises, one could block or flag a payment for review.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-machine-learning-experts?utm_source=Bgbanner_al&amp;utm_medium=mlfraud_15905_rg121&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15937" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/machine-learning-1.jpg" alt="machine learning development" width="810" height="152" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/machine-learning-1.jpg 810w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/machine-learning-1-300x56.jpg 300w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/machine-learning-1-768x144.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" /></a></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>
<h4><b>Scalable</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thriving online business helped companies to increase the transaction volume. With a rules only system, increasing the amount of payment and customer data puts more pressure on the rules library to expand. Nevertheless, in machine learning, it’s the opposite &#8211;  more data is better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put that in metaphor, &#8216;A 500 CC motorbike(bullet) gives more efficiency when it covers long distances&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The machine learning system improves more massive datasets because it is a mixed bag. Good &amp; bad e.g. both genuine and fraudulent customers. It means the model can pick out the differences and similarities between behaviors more quickly and forecast fraud in future transactions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>
<h4><b>Accuracy</b></h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breaking into non- intuitive patterns or subtle trends is not that easy for humans. ML can form new ways together. And we know fraud analysts are known to do this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine Learning interprets normal behavior better. So when it sees any malicious activity, it raises a flat. It helps in identifying a network when there is no chargeback yet. It helps identify suspicious signals. It is giving a fair idea about copying and pasting information.</span></p>

<hr />
<p><b>The features facilitate Unsupervised learning In Fraud Detection Algorithm.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Surprises if fraud is any abnormal activity or behavior. Unsupervised learning helps in self-learning in finding hidden patterns in transactions. It involves self-learning in finding remote and unveil fraud patterns.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>How Unsupervised Machine Learning Works?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of machine learning algorithm doesn’t need labeled data. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms do not require the labeling of data. They sift through unlabeled data to look for patterns used to group data points into subsets. Most types of deep learning, including</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">neural networks, unsupervised algorithms.Unsupervised learning algorithms better suits for the following tasks.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Clustering</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Splitting the data set into groups for reality.</span></li>
<li><b>Anomaly detection.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Identifying unusual data points in a Data Set</span></li>
<li><b>Association mining</b><b>.</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying sets of items in a data set randomly occurs in a bundle.</span></li>
<li><b>Dimensionality Reduction</b><b>.</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Variables are reduced in Data Set </span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Possible Channels </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Traffic of new transactions e.g. a customer adds new 10 payment cards in an hour</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A consumer placing lots of orders of high-value goods e.g., luxury alcohol, expensive apparels</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phishing, e. technologies. email addresses a mismatch between the account name or cardholder name, or rude/profane words or threatening words</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orders received from a  particularly from an unknown location, shipping to a known fraud hotspot or a PO Box rather than regular residential address</span></li>

<hr />
<h4><strong>1) Input data</strong></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-15919" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMAGE-ML-4.png" alt="Why is Machine Learning the best for Fraud Prevention in 2020 | AI and ML application development | rent a coder | hire Machine learning app developers | Machine learning apps" width="143" height="143" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technique of Fraud Detection thrives if there is more data.</span></p>
<p><b>In the process of supervised machine learning, the data can either be segregated into good (genuine customers who have never committed fraud) and wrong (customers with a chargeback associated or labeled as fraudsters).</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2) Extract features</h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-15918" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMAGE-ML-5.png" alt="Why is Machine Learning the best for Fraud Prevention in 2020 | AI and ML application development | rent a coder | hire Machine learning app developers | Machine learning apps" width="145" height="145" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It describes customer behavior &amp; pattern, while fraudulent actions are known as fraud signals.</span></p>
<p><b>We categorize  features into five main categories, with  hundreds or thousands of individual characteristics:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Identity: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential details like Number of digits in the customer’s email address, the validity of a/c, number of devices the customer used, fraud rate of customer&#8217;s IP address.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failed transactions, average order value, risky basket contents in the initial weeks</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Payment  Methods: </b>Fraud rate of issuing banks, the similarity between customer name,  name, cards from other countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Locations: </b>Shipping address communicates to match the billing address; shipping country reaches the country of customer&#8217;s IP address and the threat of fraud at customer location.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15922" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMAGE-ML-9.png" alt="Why is Machine Learning the best for Fraud Prevention in 2020 | AI and ML application development | rent a coder | hire Machine learning app developers | Machine learning apps" width="98" height="98" /></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Network: </b>Frequencies of emails, phone no. or payment methods shared within a network, customer’s network.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-15923" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMAGE-ML-10.png" alt="Why is Machine Learning the best for Fraud Prevention in 2020 | AI and ML application development | rent a coder | hire Machine learning app developers | Machine learning apps" width="100" height="100" /><strong>3) Train Algorithm </strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-15917" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMAGE-ML-6.png" alt="Why is Machine Learning the best for Fraud Prevention in 2020 | AI and ML application development | rent a coder | hire Machine learning app developers | Machine learning apps" width="151" height="151" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solving a complex problem requires an algorithm&#8212; a set of rules. For example, they are solving mathematical equations or programming tasks. It uses customer data described by features to make predictions, e.g., fraud/ not fraud. In the beginning, this data is used on algorithms: an online seller’s historical data called a training set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more fraud in this training set, the better so that the machine has lots of examples to learn from.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>4) Create a Model</strong></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-15916" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMAGE-ML-7.png" alt="Why is Machine Learning the best for Fraud Prevention in 2020 | AI and ML application development | rent a coder | hire Machine learning app developers | Machine learning apps" width="143" height="143" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the training is done you have a business-specific model by which you can detect fraud in a millisecond. Keeping a vulture eye on the model to make sure it is behaving as it should, and it is improving. It helps improve, update, and upload a new model for every client in the system will always keep an eye on new duping techniques.</span></p>

<hr />
<h2><b>How can you tell if the model is Working?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once training is done you can check if the model is working correctly, contains some data which has never appeared to know the fraud outcomes. The model diagnoses the fraud accurately, deploys it to detect online business’ transactions. Automatic common-sense analysis on recent dates demonstrates no fraud labels to ensure if the model is working fine.</span></p>

Businesses are competing for attention in an ever-changing marketplace driven by new technology and customer demands; specifically, with the demand to develop apps rapidly increasing year after year, you took a closer look at how your company can harness this trend; into a success!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In fact, the injunction for mobile applications is projected to reach <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1262892/mobile-app-revenue-worldwide-by-segment" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1262892/mobile-app-revenue-worldwide-by-segment" data-wpel-link="external">$613 billion</a> by 2025, and it’s high time to take a deep look at every possible factor that impacts this process.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Building an app is interesting because it can take many different forms. Some apps are created quickly with little effort, while other times, you need more time and resources for something that seems almost impossible at first glance!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hence, the question for today’s discussion: how long does it take to build a mobile app, and how to create your app?</span></strong></p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-24442 size-full" title="0 AG1QWhJOHdrx Jej" src="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0_AG1QWhJOHdrx_Jej.png" alt="mobile app development duration" width="700" height="577" srcset="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0_AG1QWhJOHdrx_Jej.png 700w, https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/0_AG1QWhJOHdrx_Jej-300x247.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>

<p class="graf graf--p">Usually, the average time to form an app looks like the above image. But you can never be too sure when it comes to creating an app, as each person and company has its own unique needs. So let’s move further to know more about mobile app development, and it’s time to develop…</p>
<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The App Development Process: Key Stages to Success</span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Whether you’re creating an app from scratch for building on an existing idea, the app development process has five main stages — ideation, design, testing, launching, and scaling — allowing you to get your product to market quickly and with maximum effect.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, applications with diverse sizes and additional features have different app development times. Here, view — how much time it takes to build an app. The image placed below shows the estimated mobile app development time for each stage.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*W6v5wmqAoDlIv0WG" alt="mobile app development activity" width="800" height="400" data-image-id="0*W6v5wmqAoDlIv0WG" data-width="800" data-height="400" /></figure>

<p class="graf graf--p">If you skip any of these stages or fail to complete them successfully, your app may be less competitive in the marketplace than it could be. Take the time to consider the potential challenges that each stage may pose for you, and avoid them if possible as you build your app development plan.</p>

<hr />
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Let’s move further and view each mobile app development stage involved in creating Android and iOS mobile applications.</span></strong></p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Stage 1: Idea Generation and Research</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Choosing a mobile application idea is one of the most critical steps on your way to creating an app. This can seem challenging at first, but with some practice and guidance, you’ll be able to come up with new app ideas with ease. The best thing you can do is brainstorm as many ideas as possible you can — there’s no limit!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you need help coming up with ideas, consider using resources like Quora or Reddit. Once you have a solid list of several <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/technology-and-apps/40-best-app-startup-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>app ideas</strong></a>, sort them into categories that make sense for your situation.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, if you’re looking to create an educational app for kids, it might be helpful to separate these apps by subject (math apps, science apps) and grade level. The more specific your idea is, the easier it will be to market later.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, if you’re looking to create an educational app for kids, it might be helpful to separate these apps by subject (math apps, science apps) and grade level. The more specific your idea is, the easier it will be to market later.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Once you’ve narrowed down which idea seems best suited for development as an application based on its potential usefulness and marketability, start thinking about what features should be included in your mobile application.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This stage can take several weeks or months, depending on how complex your app is. The more complex your app, the longer it will take you to get through these stages. For a simple idea, you might be able to go from idea generation to development in just a few days or weeks.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you’re creating an app with multiple features and a lot of content, you’ll require more time for each step to ensure that everything goes smoothly.</p>
<h4 class="graf graf--h4">By the end of this step, you should get these outcomes:</h4>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Minimum Viable Product</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">User Stories</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">App Prototypes</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Stage 2: Planning it all out</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Your app will only be as good as its foundations. So, don’t rush into development too soon! Take some time at stage 2 to plan your app and think through what it should offer, what it should look like, and why it is unique. This is all about having a solid idea of what you want your finished product to be.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You need a solid foundation on which you can build your app — and you might find that some changes are needed further down the line for everything to run smoothly. So, take some time at stage 2 before proceeding into actual development — or else you could find yourself starting over again in no time at all!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you’re wondering what goes into stage 2, there are a few things to take care of.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Firstly, think about how much money you want to make from your app. You need a solid financial plan for your business, including estimating your profit margins.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Secondly, think about how long does it take to build a mobile app and how much it will cost.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Thirdly start thinking about which platform, iOS or Android, you will prefer for your app development and which technology AI, IoT, Blockchain, or others you will incorporate to make your app amazing and unique.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">And lastly, start thinking about who you might be able to team up with — whether they’re programmers or designers, or people with other analytics and social media marketing skills.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So how long does it take to complete this stage of mobile app development? Well, that depends on your business plan. But you should be aiming for around three months if you want to get a basic version of your app up and running.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Stage 3: Design &amp; Prototyping</h3>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*n-YAGUR3IudR2m3g" alt="stages of mobile app" width="800" height="468" data-image-id="0*n-YAGUR3IudR2m3g" data-width="902" data-height="528" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p" style="padding-left: 280px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">      Image Source: ScienceSoft</span></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">With a working prototype, you will be able to gauge how your users interact with your product, test different design options, and ensure that various people can use it easily. A well-designed app is not only beautiful but also easy to navigate.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You should also consider developing an app for both iOS and Android platforms at once. It’s much easier (and cheaper) to develop an app for one platform first and then port it over than it is to create two separate apps from scratch.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">During prototyping, you may want to bring in a professional designer or<a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers?utm_source=MobileAppdeveloper&amp;utm_medium=Anu_B11&amp;utm_id=MobileAppDevelopers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"> hire mobile app developers </a>— but don’t do so until after testing out some designs on friends or family members who fit your target market.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This way, if they have trouble using your prototype or suggest changes based on their feedback, you won’t have wasted money by bringing in outside help too early.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Before final app development, you will also want to finalize your app’s features. You’ll need a combination of key features that are popular and unique ones that make your app stand out from competitors.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Popular features include in-app chat, photo sharing, and push notifications; unique ones depend on your target market. If you have more than one key feature idea, choose just one or two and add others later if you find they are needed.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The important thing is not to overload users with too many options or confuse them by providing duplicate functionality in different parts of your app.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This stage may take several weeks, depending on how many changes you make. However, the more iterations you go through; however, the more time you’ll save in development and testing.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, if it takes a week for each iteration of your prototype, but you need three iterations before moving on to app development, that’s three weeks — or nine weeks total.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, if it only takes one week per iteration and you need three iterations before moving on to app development, that’s only three weeks — saving six weeks!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Stage 4: Mobile App Development</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">During development, a talented developer takes your concept and gives it life. You’ll usually have at least one face-to-face meeting per week to discuss details. This is where you work out any potential kinks in your idea and make sure everything from features to the user experience will be what you want it to be.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Sometimes these meetings feel like brainstorming sessions where you’re throwing out ideas and seeing which ones stick; other times, things will feel more structured. Whatever happens, your mobile app developers should always give you solid feedback that lets you decide if an idea is worth pursuing or not.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The mobile app development stage mainly includes:</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>Fron-end development</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong>Back-end development</strong></p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Front-end refers to a graphical user interface (GUI) that is more interactive and intuitive, making it easier for users to use. Moreover, front-end development includes an app’s design, color scheme, logo and branding, animations or transitions between screens or menus, etc.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Back-end refers to how data is handled behind the scenes by developers. This includes processing information, storing data, integrating with other systems, etc.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The back-end of an application will be most important for business apps as they often require complex processes that must run smoothly for an app to work correctly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The development stage is one of the long stages in an app’s life cycle. Depending on how complex your app is and how many developers you need to work on it, it can take a few months to a year or more.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">During development, you’ll want to check in with your developer regularly and make sure they’re meeting all your expectations.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If something isn’t running right or if you have any questions, it’s best to bring them up as soon as possible to work together on finding solutions.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">To keep track of everything that happens during mobile app development, it helps to have a project manager who will be able to organize tasks and keep everyone involved updated on what’s happening at all times.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Stage 5: Testing, Bug Fixing, And Submission</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">After spending weeks or months building your app, you’ll want it out into the real world as soon as possible. This stage is all about getting feedback on how it works and how you can improve it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You may even decide to make changes based on some of these ideas, though ultimately, most <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/hire-developers/hire-mobile-app-developers?utm_source=MobileAppdeveloper&amp;utm_medium=Anu_B11&amp;utm_id=MobileAppDevelopers" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">mobile app developers</a> want to get their app onto as many devices as possible.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are a few ways you can do testing, including using beta testing sites like TestFlight and BetaBound. If you choose to take that route, remember to be open with users about what they’re signing up for.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">They should know what kind of experience they can expect from an early version of your app and whether there will be bugs needing fixing.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Also, keep in mind that once you submit your app for review, Apple has 30 days to approve it before it goes live in the App Store (unless there are significant issues). Moreover, if you’re planning to launch an Android app, note that Google Play also has its submission process.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The good news is that Google tends to have a faster turnaround time than Apple does; however, it’s also more challenging to get your app approved because Google doesn’t let just any developer publish apps on its platform. In fact, only one percent of submissions make it through!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In completion of this stage, several days to weeks will be spent testing, bug fixing, and submission. The time it takes for an app to go from development into beta testing and then finally onto app stores can vary greatly depending on each project. The more popular your app is expected to be, then the longer it may take for you to get it out there.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Stage 6: Monetization</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Monetization occurs during production. The main ways to monetize an app include paid downloads, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. After launching your app, you will be able to see exactly how many downloads and in-app purchases you are getting, which can help you make future decisions regarding monetization.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You may also consider running a free trial for your app or offering a free version of it that contains adverts. This could help increase revenue from advertising and raise brand awareness for your business.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You should also consider employing Google Analytics to monitor user activity on your app and find out where they are dropping off when using it. This information can then be used to improve functionality within the app and make it more user-friendly.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Suppose you have chosen not to offer any in-app purchases or ads with your product. You may want to consider selling it on a marketplace such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play Store instead of creating an entirely new website for users to purchase from directly.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Factors That Usually Slow Down The Mobile App Development Process</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Here view the various factors that usually slow down or halt app development. These are some of the most common causes of delay in app development. And they are often effortless to avoid. So, let’s take a glance at them one by one:</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Mid-project Changes</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Mid-project change is one of the most common causes of delay in app development. And it can occur at any stage of an app’s lifecycle. For example, clients may decide that they want their app to do something else. Or maybe they want a new feature added in. This type of change can be pretty disruptive and add cost and time delays to your project.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The best way to detour these issues is through clear communication and good planning before developing your app. Agreeing on exactly what you are going to build before you start building will help assure that everyone is on board with any modifications made during development.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Unexperienced Developers</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Another common cause of delay in app development is inexperienced mobile app developers. This can be a genuine concern if you choose a developer who doesn’t have much experience in your field.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, if you are building an app for iOS and your developer has never developed an iOS app before. There is a good possibility that they will run into problems and delays during development.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You need to ensure that your developer has experience with whatever platform or technology you are using for your project. The same goes for any other specialist skills required for your project.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A great way to find out how experienced a potential developer is by checking their online portfolio and seeing what kind of work they have done in the past.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Complex Technologies</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The complexity of your app can also have a significant impact on how long it takes to develop.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, creating an app that uses complex technologies like augmented reality or computer vision will take longer for your developer to complete. These apps require specialist skills and technology that most developers don’t have.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This means they will need more time and resources to build them. It is worth noting that these apps are becoming more common, so it shouldn’t be too hard for you to find a developer with experience.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"></h4>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">How to Sprint Up The Time of Application Development?</h3>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1mE4oqQKworqPbEt" alt="mobile app development timeline" width="800" height="640" data-image-id="0*1mE4oqQKworqPbEt" data-width="1000" data-height="800" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">The fastest way of application development is getting it from a real mobile app development company with good professionals working for them because they have all things under control.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You will have different types of apps at your disposal, and you can pick up which one works best for you. All in all, several things can be done to speed up application development in general and make it go more smoothly; some of them are:</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">MVPs And Prototyping</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The idea of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is a very important one in speeding up mobile app development because it allows you to get something out there that real people can use. It will enable you to test your concept, find flaws, and fix them without spending too much time creating something that may not work.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Prototyping is also important because it allows you to create an actual working version of your application that can be tested with real users before starting full-scale development. This will help you speed up things considerably and ensure that what you’re doing makes sense.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Hire A Professional Developer</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Many people think that they can do it all on their own and don’t need help from others. However, if you want to speed up things, you should hire mobile app developers. Because they will get things done much faster than you would be able to do them.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Agile Development</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is another great way of speeding up mobile app development. It allows you to create a working version of your application as soon as possible. It also helps you test things out, make changes, and fix bugs quickly, which you need when trying to speed up things.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">White Label Solutions</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you’re trying to speed up mobile app development, it’s good to go with white label solutions. It is because they will allow you to get a working version of your application much faster.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">A white label solution is an existing application that has been modified for something else. This means that you don’t have to spend time creating everything from scratch and can use something that already exists.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Automated Testing</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you’re trying to speed up mobile app development, it’s good to go with automated testing. Because it allows you to test your application without using it. This is superb because it will allow you to test things on a very large scale and ensure that everything works as intended.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="graf graf--h3">In today’s digital era, your business is completely dependent on Web and Mobile applications. Therefore, application support and maintenance services appear to be a primary concern to get things going. Now, you must be thinking, why should you do that? Well, let’s dive deep, then.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Think About The Following Issues</span></strong></p>
<ol class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li">Who takes care of your website, software, and apps when they crash?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Who resolves the issue when they catch a bug?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">Do you update your website, software, or apps at the right time?</li>
<li class="graf graf--li">What will you do when your Website gets hacked?</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outsource a good IT company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop their applications, but they forget about the app maintenance or do not care about it after creating the app. Ultimately, this results in business loss as the app stops functioning and engaging customers like it was previously doing. So focus more on Application Maintenance. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So, What Is Application Maintenance?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Application Maintenance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is just the same as that of your car servicing. You need to take good care of it, including replacing old functionalities with new ones and keeping things in order so that the app doesn&#8217;t display errors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you are wondering what application maintenance means for the business world, you just need to understand that it is a practice employed by business owners and managers to keep their applications updated with new features, functionalities, and security patches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, application development and maintenance help fix technical glitches or system errors as soon as they appear. There are many models for application maintenance, but it&#8217;s an ongoing process with a strong relationship between the business and IT team members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model may vary with different app types or systems that you have to keep updated for optimum performance. Let&#8217;s discuss different ‌models for application maintenance practices:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Onsite Model/ On-Premise Solution: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model involves allocating resources to manage servers and other IT infrastructure that business organizations use on-premises. This works well when there is no predetermined service level agreement with the provider.</span></li>
<li><b>On Cloud Model/SaaS Solution: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model is used to deploy SAAS on the cloud, which includes allocating resources for IT infrastructure externally that third-party providers manage &amp; business organizations use it just like they use any other internet services (emails or social media account). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works well when there is a predetermined service level agreement with the provider. </span></li>
<li><b>Managed Model/MSP Solution:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In this model, business organizations allocate resources for IT infrastructure and keep it managed by providers or third-party professionals skilled in handling such services on the cloud. This way of mobile app maintenance services helps to focus more on core business tasks and stay ahead in the competition.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Deloitte report says that 60% of the outsourcers prefer to hire Application Maintenance &amp; support.</span></p>

<h2 class="graf graf--h3"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Importance of Application Maintenance</strong></span></h2>
<p class="graf graf--p">Let’s take an example of your house. After buying or building it, do you just forget about it? Or think about budgeting your time and money for ongoing utilities, repairs, and renovations? Undoubtedly, the second one.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The same concept is applicable to your <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">application development</a> and maintenance. Every project of yours is going to require at least some amount of ongoing maintenance. However, maintenance is not only about maintaining, it’s also about improving and evolving gradually.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">In technology, you are either enhancing yourself or you’re falling back. Here, you can’t just standstill. User needs are changing every day and if you don’t have a regular maintenance strategy in place, you’re lagging behind. Hence, Application Maintenance is important. Really important!</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Now that you know mobile app maintenance services are essential, you need to know what are the benefits too. Here are a few of them-</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Scalability and Security</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Regular maintenance makes sure your application is secure from all external threats. At the same time, your applications become much more scalable. It enables it to accommodate larger workloads while keeping consistent and acceptable levels of performance.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cost-saving</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is not a cost-saving plan if you buy new software or develop from scratch whenever it crashes or catches bugs. Furthermore, it is way better to maintain the same on a regular basis to enhance the lifetime and reduce future costs through mobile and <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/web-application-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">web application development</a> and maintenance.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Application maintenance improves the quality, web presence, and response time of your apps and websites. This does not only help to evolve with time but also fulfills customer requirements better. As a result, the satisfaction level also improves.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peace of Mind</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Once you know your mobile software applications are in safe hands, and you do not need to do anything extra for the upcoming few years, peace of mind automatically comes. Hence, you can focus on other attributes of your business.</p>

<hr />
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Bug Fixing</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Bugs are common when developing and maintaining websites. When bugs enter code, they can cause issues in your application’s functionality or, even worse — render it completely useless!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The most frequent type of bug is an error that occurs during last-minute changes to a product’s source code; these usually originate from buggy third-party tools used by web entrepreneurs, as well as failures to use version control systems effectively enough (which we all know isn’t easy).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Application maintenance is not an easy process that can be handover to any application maintenance company without rigorous thought. Bugs can be introduced at any time during the coding of your application, making it crucial to regularly test and retest for defects or glitches in order to maintain a stable product.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Moreover, the product won’t turn away customers with bugs. Website entrepreneurs who develop online products must take care when updating their websites’ code because doing so could result in some unexpected errors being displayed by visitors on the screen, which may irritate them greatly if they’re trying to just get serious work done instead!</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nAivJkW8GEgeT89g" alt="Bug Fixing" width="800" height="572" data-image-id="0*nAivJkW8GEgeT89g" data-width="860" data-height="615" /></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Bugs, like any other animal in the wild, can be a hazard to your application’s functionality. Bugs may occur and cause hindrances to how it performs its tasks, or even make things worse for no apparent reason at all!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It is important not only because bugs might inconvenience you, but also because they bring down quality by taking up time from developers who could otherwise spend their days making better products instead (and we know that 5% — 10% bug elimination costs happen more often than not).</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Save Time and Money</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">When you trust your IT infrastructure and application management team for mobile app maintenance services, time becomes a much more valuable resource. When the professionals at this company run efficient systems for saving resources on core business processes in order to maximize profit margins while maintaining peak performance — they always have one goal: customer satisfaction!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">At the same time, several companies are struggling because these old legacy apps aren’t being phased out fast enough, which means there continues exposure into other critical areas like data backup or disaster recovery plans.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">All potential weaknesses must be identified during both web and mobile <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/application-maintenance" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>application maintenance</strong></a> services, which could lead back to becoming reputed by hackers, should be safeguarded against with professional help from expert technicians who specialize specifically when it comes down to running powerful software without any issues whatsoever.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Need For Specialists</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Maintaining an IT infrastructure is no easy task, but it becomes even more challenging when you need to find skilled specialists. This leaves your company with less time for other necessary projects and may lead them to further complications down the line.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Application support and maintenance services can provide these full-time staff members that are needed in order to keep up engineering tools within organizations where internal teams often fail because of insufficient manpower or conflicting priorities between different departments, which causes errors on their part leading to downtime wreaking havoc among all types of businesses worldwide.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Experiencing Change</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The IT world is a tumultuous place. The changes are always coming at an unexpected rate, and you never know what’s going to be thrown your way next — but with application management on board, all those problems disappear!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Application development and maintenance managers will take care of everything from updating applications automatically or by request; they’ve seen it before, so there’s no need for concern when future issues surface that require their expertise.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The company providing this service has been doing such things since time immemorial: they’re experts in handling change because every day brings something new into our lives.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure" style="padding-left: 40px;"><img decoding="async" class="graf-image aligncenter" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*uU6qzeHcfpJBPIqk" alt="Application maintenance companies, Application maintenance services India, Application maintenance support and services" width="717" height="535" data-image-id="0*uU6qzeHcfpJBPIqk" data-width="717" data-height="535" /></figure>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Assessing Performance</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Application management using the best app for this purpose will help you measure storage, performance, and many other things.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">With hard numbers like these available in your organization’s system of record (the application), managers can ensure their applications perform as expected, whether it be meeting goals or seeking improvements- all through real-time data collection from within its own framework!</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--p"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Keep Tracking</strong></span></h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The final step of the application support and maintenance services process can be a difficult one, as bugs cause issues for your product. Bugs that are not fixed will give developers headaches and affect their work daily with time-consuming app monitoring tasks.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This leads many companies to outsource these applications in order to save money from having multiple employees focus on just parts or all aspects related to it instead of spreading yourselves too thinly across different areas outside engineering if you have enough manpower already at hand working solely towards fixing those problems!</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This not only saves companies from financial penalties caused by poor maintenance but also enables the users to enjoy stable functioning of their applications through constant changes and new products developed day-in/day-out without interruption or downtime for customers who depend on these services in order to perform efficiently at work every single day.</p>

<h2><b>Why do Startups, SMEs, and Big Brands Focus On App Maintenance?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 5 reasons mentioned here will help you understand why application development and maintenance services both are crucial.   </span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Re-engineering For Extraordinary Performance</strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet user&#8217;s requirements and increase customer engagement, it&#8217;s crucial to focus on the latest trends; this is why top brands like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are focusing on embracing Augmented Reality (AR), <a href="https://www.valuecoders.com/ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI), Virtual Reality, Predictive Analytics, etc. </span></p>
<h3><strong>5. User Adoption To Boost Market Reach</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of application support and maintenance services and up-gradation can make your app outdated; this may impact the app&#8217;s user adoption rate. Nowadays, users just prefer using the modernized version of the application and software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So to make your app more extraordinary, focus on adopting the concepts that users require today; this will profit in enhancing user experience and user adoption rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the business will not center on the App Maintenance part, the business cannot meet users&#8217; desires, ultimately resulting in a waning number of users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, from 2006 to 2010, Orkut&#8217;s name was quite popular. All users liked this social media platform, but it&#8217;s fame was sustainable for a precise time frame due to the absence of maintenance. So note if you need to maintain the app popularity level, focus on the app updation and maintenance part.</span></p>
<h2 class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Wrapping It Up</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No legacy can go forever; it&#8217;s essential to know when to update or upgrade. If you want to make your business application popular like Amazon, focus on both application development and application maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, after going through the write-up, if you have made your intention to avail of</span> Application Maintenance services, <span style="font-weight: 400;">get in touch with the top-notch </span>Application Maintenance company in India (ValueCoders)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the information mentioned in the infographic might help you know about Blockchain. So now, let&#8217;s move to the future and talk about how Blockchain in the future will help businesses in growing. </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>How is Blockchain Helping Various Business Verticals In Growing?</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pointers mentioned below will help you know how Blockchain technology is helping various industry verticals in boosting their growth. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Blockchain in the Healthcare Sector</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blockchain can be used for identity verification and fraud prevention, which could help save healthcare providers time and money.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical records, including prescriptions and insurance information</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug history, allergies, or current treatments</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immunization data.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Blockchain In Real Estate Industry</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blockchain is also being used in the real estate industry to help with transactions and titles. They are able to do this without a central authority because of their decentralized nature.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A buyer or seller can upload a title deed and related documents to the Blockchain, which then certifies them as valid</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parties involved in transactions use an online contract that is stored on the chain</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transactions are recorded openly so they cannot be changed without others knowing about it (it’s not possible for one party to use a Blockchain network without others knowing)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Blockchain in the Banking Sector</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blockchain can record transactions in a way that they cannot be tampered with, which is useful for banks that need to verify transactions.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks can benefit from this technology as well by using it for remittances, cross-border payments, securities trades, regulatory compliance, identity management, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no need for an intermediary, like a third-party resource. Transactions are carried out peer-to-peer in real-time without any delay.   </span></li>
</ul>

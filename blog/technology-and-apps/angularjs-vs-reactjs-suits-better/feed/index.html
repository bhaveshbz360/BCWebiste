Thanks for your suggestion.. This article was published before the official release of AngularJS 2. That&#039;s why you found the discripency. However, if now we consider about Angular 2 then you are quite right.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No offense. However, there are several places which are not accurate in this article.
I need add something just in case this article may mislead people. Take SEO for example, your SEO advantage of React is over Angular 1, not for Angular 2. Angular 2 does a better job in some places, for example, the rendering isn’t synchronous. It won’t block the event loop on the server as much as React.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stupid comparison. These are not the same thing and don&#039;t do the same thing.  Angular is a Javascript framework.  React only addresses the view.  The very fact that the author conflates these two, means one should not use this company.  It&#039;s like saying &quot;What&#039;s best for your business?  An accounting package or a new truck?&quot;  Apples and oranges, mate.]]></description>

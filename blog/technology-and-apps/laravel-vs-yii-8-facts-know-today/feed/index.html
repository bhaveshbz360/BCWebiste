					<description><![CDATA[&quot;However, if you are looking for a framework that offers simple 
development opportunity and your goal is to develop small to medium 
grade applications then Yii2 is your cut.&quot;

Lol, that was funny. FYI, Yii can do everything what Laravel can. Laravel is a great framework, one of the great frameworks, nothing more. Please, don&#039;t sell utopias, there is no silver bullets.

PD: I&#039;m an ex-CodeIgniter lover and former Laravel user]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From what I’ve seen on multiple forums, people, who started working with Laravel&lt;/a&gt; and tried to master Yii later claimed that it was uncomfortable and odd to deal with. And vice versa. At the end of the day, there’s no clear winner here. It’s up to you to decide which one suits you best according to your requirment]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think Yii2 is way better than laravel.
It has all laravel functionalities and more. All above mentioned facets are enough for me to use Yii over laravel.

Yii2 have more standards. and consistency.
I&#039;m using Yii1 for 2 years, and Yii2 for few months.
You can&#039;t say it is better because laravel used worldwide more than Yii.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not agree with your point related to Routing, totally. Actually, I think is validating or whitelisting of each url is required in the current scenario for security purposes. sometimes a path from outside is executed in our server. If we have a list of whitelisted url, isn&#039;t it good. 

In most of the operation CRUD is required only once command can make all the routes related to crud operations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not agree with your first point that is Laravel does not support scenario based validation. There is a concept of DI(dependency injection) whenever you call a method of a controller you can inject a Request class in it. This request class can be different for both of the scenarios for update and add.]]></description>

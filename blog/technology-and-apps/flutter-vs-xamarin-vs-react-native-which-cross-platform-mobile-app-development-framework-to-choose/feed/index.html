					<description><![CDATA[This is a tough call for any developer. But, I would say React Native has made its topmost position in the list of the cross-app development framework. 
Although, there are multiple factors to keep in mind while choosing the framework. Thanks for putting this comparative data.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is really hard to say which framework is better for our business. Because, Flutter, React Native, and Xamarin are equally good at developing successful mobile apps. Better you think before choosing that would be the right fit for your business.  

We know that, some prefer react native for coding while others like Flutter and Xamarin. 

Nice Post! Thanks for sharing]]></description>
